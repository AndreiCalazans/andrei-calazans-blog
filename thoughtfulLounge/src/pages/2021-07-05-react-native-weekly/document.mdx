Welcome to the 16th edition of React Native Weekly = ) 

_This a slow week with less commits than usual._


# Specify whether DevMenu is bridgeless or bridge

[The commit message](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c7d34527c9d) mentions how the Facebook app can have both bridge and bridgeless surfaces in their app, and since the DevMenu for each are different it makes a better developer experience to tag which is which.

This teaches us that there will be a different DevMenu for Fabric mode with the DevMenu called `React Native Debug Menu Bridgeless`


```
+  NSString *debugMenuType = self.bridge ? @"Bridge" : @"Bridgeless";
+  NSString *debugMenuTitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"React Native Debug Menu (%@)", debugMenuType];
```



# Fix CMD + OPT + R with Bridgeless mode only [iOS]

[In this commit](8c746dfc7e6) Ramanpreet Nara <ramanpreet@fb.com> adds a fix for the dev reload shortcut, the code that handles this shortcut in `RCTDevSettings.mm` only worked it was instantiated by the bridge which will no longer exist in Fabric mode. 

The change adds a listener to it that gets setup when the `RCTDevSettings` is first instantiated.



# Fix crash when PlatformColor is used as backgroundColor

When PlatformColor is used with backgroundColor, this line would throw, as the object type is not convertible to int.

# Add mechanism to enforce certain Views always being visible in the View hierarchy [Android]

[In this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/34903ba4185), Joshua Gross <joshuagross@fb.com> writes about this addition as an opt-in mechanism to allow native Android Views to be marked as "not clippable", soft exceptions will be logged if these Views are clipped from the View hierarchy.

He notes how telemetry components might rely on the component lifecycle like `onDraw` to work properly and for this reason they can't be clipped. This situation happened more often with Fabric and its View Flattening mechanism.

In JS the solution is to add `collapsable=false` to the parent component of the clipped view, and/or move the View higher up the hierarchy.



# Added a Pressable Sticky Header Example to RNTester

[Work from](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/40a93914c69) Kacie Bawiec <kacieb@fb.com>:

> Add a test case showing off a pressable sticky header to RNTester.

All you have to do is set which index is the sticky item `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}`


```javascript
function StickyHeader() {
  const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = React.useState('blue');
  return (
    <View
      key={0}
      style={{
        backgroundColor: backgroundColor,
        margin: 10,
        width: 500,
        height: 100,
      }}>
      <Pressable
        style={{flex: 1}}
        onPress={() => {
          setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor === 'blue' ? 'yellow' : 'blue');
        }}
        testID="pressable_header">
        <Text>Press to change color</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}

function renderComponent1(i) {
  return (
    <View
      key={i}
      style={{backgroundColor: 'red', margin: 10, width: 500, height: 100}}
    />
  );
}

export default function ScrollViewPressableStickyHeaderExample(): React.Node {
  const scrollRef = React.useRef(null);
  const components = [];
  for (var i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    components.push(renderComponent1(i));
  }
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ScrollView
        nestedScrollEnabled={true}
        ref={scrollRef}
        style={{flex: 1}}
        stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}
        showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
        testID="scroll_pressable_sticky_header">
        <StickyHeader />
        {components}
      </ScrollView>
      <View>
        <Button
          title="scroll to top"
          onPress={() => {
            scrollRef.current?.scrollTo({y: 0});
          }}
          testID="scroll_to_top_button"
        />
        <Button
          title="scroll to bottom"
          onPress={() => {
            scrollRef.current?.scrollToEnd();
          }}
          testID="scroll_to_bottom_button"
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

```

# Tweet From Fernando Rojo on Coinbase's Peformance Article

[Fernando posted](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1411011190361407489?s=20):

> @coinbase Your article on optimizing React Native is a game changer. DeactivateContextOnBlur wildly improved performance for my search screen when editing search filters from global state.

[The article is from last year](https://blog.coinbase.com/optimizing-react-native-7e7bf7ac3a34) and probably worth reading if Fernando said that.
