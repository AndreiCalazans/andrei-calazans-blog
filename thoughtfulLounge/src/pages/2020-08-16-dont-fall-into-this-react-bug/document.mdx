<h2 id="unmergeable">Unmergeable state</h2>


React's `useState` setter function does not automatically merge your state. This behavior is different from the class's `setState` function.

For example:


```jsx
// Inside a functional component
[state, setState] = useState({ name: 'Andrei' });

// In a callback. When you call setState:
setState({ age: 12 }); 
```


What is the resulting state after the setState call?

<SetStateExample />



<h2 id="mergeable">Mergeable State</h2>

With Class' `setState` the behavior is different:

```jsx
// Inside a class component
state = { name: 'Andrei' };

// In a callback. When you call this.setState:
this.setState({ age: 12 }); 

```

<ClassSetState />



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

Don't be a victim to this change of behavior when you migrate to the `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
