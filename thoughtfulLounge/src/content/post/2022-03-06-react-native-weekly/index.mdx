## Include folly fabric headers in source files [iOS] [Fabric]

Danilo BÃ¼rger info@danilobuerger.de [fixed a compilation](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/56dda14c465) issue on iOS when including `react-native-safe-area-context` 4.0.1 with Fabric enabled.

## Performance logger concurrent mode annotation

The [performance logger will now contain an annotation to tag if in concurrent mode](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9d1400a1efe).

## Added Runtime.getHeadUsage for Hermes 

Janic Duplessis <janicduplessis@gmail.com [added Runtime.getHeapUsage](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cff9590864c) for Hermes Chrome inspector.

This will enable seeing a summary of memory usage from JavaScript in Devtools.


## Migrating codegenNativeComponent to be Bridgeless compatible

Paige Sun paigesun@fb.com migrated the `codegenNativeComponent` to be Bridgeless compatible.

We learn to use `UIManager.hasViewManagerConfig` to check the existence of a view manager instead of `UIManager.getViewManagerConfig` to be bridgeless compatible.



## Introduce _viewRegistry_DEPRECATED addUIBlock for Fabric migration

Paige Sun paigesun@fb.com [added `_viewRegistry_DEPRECATED addUIBlock`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2c268d7fe65) to make it easier to migrate View Managers to Fabric. 

With Fabric the UIManager will no longer exist, and the use `uiManager addUIBlock` will need to be replaced by `_viewRegistry_DEPRECATED addUIBlock`.

Paige also [exemplified the migration to "Bridgeless" mode with the DatePickerIOS](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/260c5fab9ff).


## Fix transform when calculate overflowInset

This contribution is a clear example of how the shared C++ interface benefits from work focused on one of the platforms - Android.

Xin Chen xch@fb.com [fixed overflowInset calculation](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0975e96d535) when a shadow node has transform matrix from a transform prop in JS.

note how Xin has made various improvements to Android which seem related to supporting VR based on what I've followed so far. 

Xin's commit message goes into great detail into the problem he faced plus fix.


## Improve rendering of images when resampled and corner radius applied [Android]

Pieter De Baets pieterdb@fb.com [improved rendering](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f743bed6575) images by enabling [`paintFilterBitmap`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint#FILTER_BITMAP_FLAG) when rendering images with rounded corners.


## Guarantee configureNdkBild depends on preBuild task [Android]

According to Nicola Corti ncor@fb.com, [due to a bug with AGP](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/207403732), the configureNdkBuild* tasks are not depending on preBuild tasks. Thus, [Nicola added a fix](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2fdbf6a10fe) which manually guarantees this dependency.



## Added Event and CustomEvent W3c-compatible polyfills 

Joshua Gross joshuagross@fb.com [added these polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6abbef1200a) in preparation for upcoming changes.



## Fixed error caused by re-registering bubbling event by RCTModalHostView  

According HeyImChris 48299693+HeyImChris@users.noreply.github.com they are seeing the following error `Component 'RCTModalHostView' re-registered bubbling event 'topDismiss' as a direct event moduleConstantsForComponent` on a react-native-macOS build.

This is fixed by replacing RCTBubblingEventBlock for RCTDirectEventBlock.

## Setup a Gradle build inside `ReactAndroid/hermes-engine` to download Hermes sources

[Adapted from Nicola's commit message](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/191fc0f7cca), Nicola Corti ncor@fb.com started a Gradle build inside `ReactAndroid/hermes-engine` to kickoff a small project where we can download Hermes sources and start a compilation of Hermes sources from there.


## Added asBool() method to JSI Value

Scott Kyle skyle@fb.com [added the `asBool()` method](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/603620b7394) to the JSI object for easier conversion of data.


## Allow usage of TurboModules in context with RTTI

Nikita Lutsenko nlutsenko@fb.com [moved the definitions of TurboModule's virtual methods to declaration](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1f877296973) to allow for use in context with RTTI.
