Welcome to the 32nd edition of React Native Weekly! 


This is week 44 of 2021: October 25th and 31st.


# Fix devDisabledInStaging not working with multiple productFlavors [Android]

Geraint White <geraintwhite@gmail.com>'s [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/055ea9c7b7d) fixes the ability to disable dev builds for specific build target (product flavor).  


Now you can define a `disableDevForVariant` lambda in `build.gradle` `project.ext.react` to define if this build variant should have dev build disabled.

```
project.ext.react = [
    ...
    disableDevForVariant: {
         def variant -> variant.name.toLowerCase().contains('release') || variant.name.toLowerCase().contains('live')
    },
    ...
]
```

# Add bundleForVariant option [Android]

Geraint White <geraintwhite@gmail.com> [also implemented](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d2c10da5d56) a `bundleForVariant` lambda. The bundle output (.aab) is an optimized APK which the Play Store can derive all the APK architecture from.

With `bundleForVariant` you can now define to use the bundle option per build variant. Similar to `disableDevForVariant`:

```
  bundleForVariant: {
       def variant -> variant.name.toLowerCase().contains('release') || variant.name.toLowerCase().contains('live')
  },
```

# Update XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders() implementation


Andrew Scherkus <ascherkus@gmail.com> [updated](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b2415c48669) `getAllResponseHeaders` to conform with the XHR whatwg spec.

> As per the XMLHttpRequest specification [1], getAllResponseHeaders() should return a string of headers with lowercased names and sorted by their uppercase representation, with each header ending with '\r\n'. [1] https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-getallresponseheaders()-method




# Expose Pressability Hover config props in Pressable

Saad Najmi <sanajmi@microsoft.com> highlighted how `react-native-macos`, `react-native-windows`, and `react-native-web` all already support mouse hover events since the underlying Pressability module already calculates onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave events. The core React Native Pressable event wasn't sending these events because the props were not forwarded - [Saad fixes this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1b30dd074b5).


# Fix Switch crash [Android]

The Switch component is crashing when initialized with both backgroundColor and thumbColor.

Stefanos Markidis <stmarkidis@gmail.com>'s [fix](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/456cf3db14c) and summary:

> ReactSwitch component is crashing on Android when it is initialised with both a backgroundColor and thumbColor, `style={{ backgroundColor: "anyColor" }} thumbColor="anyColor"`, due to IllegalCastException.


Red screen will show highlighting an IllegalCastException.

With fix:

`backgroundColor` with `thumbColor`:
![backgroundColor + thumbColor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4354327/138615603-141660d2-a5cd-49d7-aa5e-9c93ebc6d680.gif)

Just `thumbColor`:

# Fix #flingAndSnap to check all the scroll item for offset range [Android]

According to Xin Chen <xch@fb.com>, when the ScrollView calculated the offset of the items it skipped the first item since it assumed the offset was zero, turns out this is not always the case and thus [this diff](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/61e1b6f86cf) fixes this.




# Added `isAccessibilityServiceEnabled` to get if accessibility services are enabled [Android]

grgr-dkrk <40130327+grgr-dkrk@users.noreply.github.com>'s [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c8b83d4e0b3) adds `isAccessibilityServiceEnabled`:

```javascript
  AccessibilityInfo.isAccessibilityServiceEnabled().then(state => {
    this.setState({isEnabled: state});
  });
```


# React Freeze

[Krzysztof Magiera's thread](https://twitter.com/kzzzf/status/1454087372895883266) on performance audit of RN apps to announce React Freeze - an experimental library that uses Suspense to prevent portions of React trees from rendering.

If you are using react-navigation you can try it just by upgrading to react-native-screens 3.9 and calling `enableFreeze(true)`.


# Dripsy V3

Dripsy is worth checking out, specially if you need responsive UI. This library created by Fernando Rojo is an unstyled, responsive UI primitives for React Native + Web.

# Monorepo example

[Victor Malov](https://twitter.com/vicmalov) posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/vicmalov/status/1453786588564148226) sharing his Monorepo workflow for React Native that supports:

 - TypeScript
 - Yarn v3 Face screaming in fear
 - Yarn Workspaces
 - TypeScript Project References
 - Multiple RN example apps: 0.65.1, 0.66.0, 0.66.1
 - Shared example code
