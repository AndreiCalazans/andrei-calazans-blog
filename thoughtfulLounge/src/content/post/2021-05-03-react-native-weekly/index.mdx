# Hades - an improved Garbage Collector

Hermes has another update!

[Tzvetan Mikov announced on Twiter another update to Hermes](https://twitter.com/tmikov/status/1387126479801126913?s=20), an improved garbage collector. He mentioned it has 30x shorted GC pause times on 64-bit devices, and up to 14x shorter on 32-bit devices.

He explained they were able to achieve this by moving the work to a background thread to happen concurrently with the interpreter running JavaScript code, in constract to how it was previously running on the same thread as the interpreter.


# React Native + Next.js File Based Routing

Fernando Rojas is working on a file based routing system based on Next.js for React Native, if you are interested checkout [his post](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1388572885833375756?s=20).


# Why Aren't You Using Hermes?

# More Improvements To The Differentiator Module

_This module contains a set of functions that does the diff when updating the `ShadowTree` and deciding what
needs to be removed or updated._

Some of the work included improving the code where it was duplicated, adding failing test case seeds, simplify logic, and delete redundant blocks.

# Implement RuntimeScheduler::getCurrentPriorityLevel

[841756b150](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/841756b150) Implement RuntimeScheduler::getCurrentPriorityLevel

The current priority level is whatever is on the top of the queue.

```
+      auto previousPriority = currentPriority_;
       while (!taskQueue_.empty()) {
-        auto topPriority = taskQueue_.top();
+        auto topPriorityTask = taskQueue_.top();
         auto now = now_();
-        auto didUserCallbackTimeout = topPriority->expirationTime <= now;
+        auto didUserCallbackTimeout = topPriorityTask->expirationTime <= now;
 
         if (!didUserCallbackTimeout && shouldYield_) {
           // This task hasn't expired and we need to yield.
           break;
         }
-
-        auto result = topPriority->execute(runtime);
+        currentPriority_ = topPriorityTask->priority;
+        auto result = topPriorityTask->execute(runtime);
```



# Upgrade to Jest 26.6.3
 
[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d6cd2e6559)


# Work To Support Bridgeless Mode

Updates were made to both the [`RCTNetworking`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4c5182c1cc) and [`RCTImageLoader`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/af6bcfa3ab) to support bridgeless mode.

The new architecture, Fabric, will be in bridgeless mode. 


# Fix For Crash On Android When Creating Negative Width Layouts


[3d0cf8dcf8](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3d0cf8dcf8) Fix IllegalArgumentException when creating layout with negative width

stacktrace:
```
stack_trace:	java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Layout: -2 < 0
	at android.text.Layout.<init>(Layout.java:265)
	at android.text.Layout.<init>(Layout.java:241)

	at android.text.BoringLayout.make(BoringLayout.java:61)

```

Now it throws a soft exception.


# Fix DatePicker sizing issue

Changing `preferredDatePickerStyle` changes size of the component without triggering re-layout of the react native screen. The fix is to make sure the size stays the same after changing the style.

# 2b67631210 Bump Hermes npm to 0.8.0

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2b67631210)


# Batch Animation setValue call in a separate batch

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Summary:

NativeAnimationModule on Android is using batches to combine related updates together. In Fabric, this process is controlled by JS, which schedules starts batching when Animated component props are about to be updated.

In rare cases when there's no prop update (like calls to `setValue` on `AnimatedValue`), changes weren't applied until the next batch was scheduled. This change ensures that such changes get applied directly.

This problem doesn't happen on iOS or non-Fabric surfaces, because they use per-frame scheduling instead.

</div>


# Migrations to NativeComponentRegistry


[cf0a6e9e27](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cf0a6e9e27) Refactor RCTMultilineTextInputNativeComponent to use NativeComponentRegistry instead of requireNativeComponent
[f76943af1a](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f76943af1a) Refactor RCTSingelineTextInputNativeComponent to use NativeComponentRegistry instead of requireNativeComponent

The intention is to unify the way the component is registered and enable StaticViewConfigs for this component



# iOS: 1/7 Add missing onDismiss prop in Modal component

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Static ViewConfigs are not yet available in Fabric. ViewConfigs are generated from Paper view managers.

For a prop to pass through from JS to iOS, props in [RCTModalHostViewNativeComponent.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/dc80b2dcb52fadec6a573a9dd1824393f8c29fdc/Libraries/Modal/RCTModalHostViewNativeComponent.js) need to match RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY in RCTModalHostViewManager.m.
