It's interesting how in ReasonML we don't need to worry much about writing types, its inference engine is nicely capable of
infering most behavior. Take the following example:

Imagine we want to use a function which takes another function as a callback parameter and calls it on its return. 

**Plain JavaScript**

```jsx
const myFunction = () => 'some-string';

const useSomeFunction = (anyFunction) => {
  return anyFunction();
}

const result = useSomeFunction(myFunction); 
/*
  * Expect result to be equal to 'some-string',
  * therefore its type should infer to string. 
*/

```

Based on the JavaScript snippet above, `result` should always infer its type to the return value of the function passed to `useSomeFunction`. Now let's
see how the different type checkers for JavaScript behave in this scenario.


**TypeScript**

```jsx
const myFunction = () => 'some-string';

const useSomeFunction = <FnType extends (...args: any[]) => any>(anyFunction: FnType): ReturnType<FnType> => {
  return anyFunction();
}

const result = useSomeFunction(myFunction);
// result is correctly infered to `string`

```

With TypeScript we can no longer just write the function, we must help TS to infer its bits. There are
a couple things going on here.

First to be able to infer any function passed as an argument to 
`useSomeFunction` we must define a generic, which we called `FnType`, cast it as an extension of a function
which can have any arguments and return anything `(...args: any[]) => any`. At the end to infer the return,
we must get the return value of our generic function `FnType` by calling it with `ReturnType`.


**Flow**

```jsx
const myFunction = () => 'some-string';

function useSomeFunction<FnType: Function>(anyFunction: FnType): $Call<FnType> {
  return anyFunction();
}

const result = useSomeFunction(myFunction);
// result is correctly infered to `string`

```

With Flow it's not so different, a generic must also be defined, but instead of extending it we define its 
type to be of a `Function`. Again the return is defined as `$Call<FnType>`. $Call is an utility helper just like `ReturnType`
which gets the type of that function's return.


**ReasonML**

```jsx
let myFunction = () => "some-string";

let useSomeFunction = (anyFunction) => anyFunction();

/* result is correctly infered to `string` */
let result = useSomeFunction(myFunction);

```

With ReasonML no type annotation is required, its engine is capable of infering the type based on the use. 
For example.

It knows `anyFunction` is a function because we are calling it inside `useSomeFunction`. If we instead added a
number:

```jsx
let myFunction = () => "some-string";

let useSomeFunction = (anyFunction) => anyFunction + 2;

let result = useSomeFunction(myFunction);

```

The above code would throw the following error:

```jsx
This has type:
  unit -> string
But somewhere wanted:
  int
```

It knows that `anyFunction` has type of `unit -> string` but you were doing an addition so you wanted an `int`.

This ability of infering types based on usage is an amazing feature of ReasonML, it lets you code faster
and confidently. It's no wonder why Developers coming from other JavaScript Static types fall in love with ReasonML, 
Static typing JS application can be become verbose and troublesome with TypeScript and Flow since one must know multiple helpers
to achieve inference correctly.
