Dave Farley does an excellent job going over the topic of how to lead technical teams. I highly recommend [you watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMpCF0Z623s).

## Notes & Comments

<mark>"Best Capitan is not always the best player"</mark>.

Leads difficulty is to allow others to work in a way they wouldn't. Micro management results in people who are unmotivated to pro-actively help.

Job of the leader is to serve the team and make them productive. 

<mark>"Being a leader is like hosting a party, inviting everyone, providing drinks, and letting them have fun"</mark>. He exemplifies being the communication point for a larger company where he worked as a lead. 

<mark>"Avoid remote-control programming"</mark> through specs. He exemplifies Architects trying to do this through high-level specs.

To lead effectively you need to allow others to work in their way and let them make mistakes - safely.

The best team leads teach the team to find their own answers. 

Consensus-based decisions. <mark>"I have strong opinions, but I hold them lightly"</mark>. 

Praise in public and critique in private. 

You should guide their performance with feedbacks constantly, don't wait for a fixed date performance review to arrive. Dave mentions he thinks it is a failure to surprise his developer in a performance review. 

If you find yourself in a position of delivery of bad news focus on them, don't spend time about talking yourself and how bad you feel for delivering this bad new.
