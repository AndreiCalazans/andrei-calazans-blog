Welcome to the 18th and first ever late edition of React Native Weekly ðŸ˜…

This is everything that happened in between 12th and 18th of July 2021.


# Fabric is coming to open source


The biggest news of last week was this [tweet](https://twitter.com/joshuaisgross/status/1415099495285608453) from Joshua Gross <joshuagross@fb.com> mentioning that they have migrated all of their 1k+ screens to Fabric and are ready to start bringing it to open source.

We can expect Fabric to land and be appropriately documented after version 0.65 of React Native according to [Lorenzo](https://twitter.com/Kelset/status/1415226909177393155?s=20)

I've mentioned in previous weekly how the fact that React Native is run on so many apps within Facebook a great way to QA how React Native is performing.

# Allow configuring ndk build architectures (#31232)

Summary from [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d6ed1ff58b2) by Janic Duplessis <janicduplessis@gmail.com>:

Building from source in debug takes a very long time because native builds need to run for all supported architectures. It is possible to check which architecture the devices for which we are about to launch the app on are and build only for those. For most cases we can reduce the number of architectures we build for to 1 instead of 4, resulting in a large speedup of the build.

This is inspired by iOS which has a "Build for active architecture only" option. Since android doesn't really support this natively we can implement it here and also in react-native by reading the build properties that we pass and alter the abi we build for.

With fabric / codegen coming up I suspect that we might want to default to building c++ soon. This should ease the transition as builds won't be orders of magnitude slower.

See https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/1388 for more context and how we use this new config to automatically detect running emulator architectures.



# Add MEDIA_STOP, MEDIA_NEXT, and MEDIA_PREVIOUS event support to Android TV (#31837)

Another external contribution, this time from TomÃ¡Å¡ Havlas <tomas@havlas.me> who is developing an TV applicaton for AndroidTV. You can learn more on how to consume these events for TV platforms [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/building-for-tv)


# Unify Typeface Logic (Android)

Some clean up around the TypeFace logic that refactors how `Typeface` style and weight are applied in React Native on Android.

In result [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9d2fedc6e22) fixes and adds:

Android[Fixed] - Fixed a rare crash due to `Typeface.sDefaultTypeface` (Android SDK) being `null`.
Android[Fixed] - Fixed font weight support for the Fabric renderer.
Android[Added] - Added a new example to test font weights in `TextInput`.

# Clean up & Extend Codegen

HÃ©ctor Ramos <hramos@fb.com> worked on Codegen this week:

[3fefe043b41](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3fefe043b41) Reorganize codegen script for clarity
[d90fe67123f](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d90fe67123f) Extend codegen script to take library name, output dir arguments


# Remove defaultProps from SegmentedControlIOS (#31804)

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/fa0518d3d37)


# Fix support for blobs larger than 64 KB on Android (#31789)

Tomek Zawadzki <tomasz.zawadzki@swmansion.com> logged the issue and also made [the change request](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f00e348ca7f). If only everyone did this React Native would be on another level ðŸ˜….

The problem was quite interesting, it turns out when an object URL containing a large blob was passed as source of `<Image />` it can hit the pipe buffer limited capacity of 65536 bytes (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html, section "Pipe capacity"). 

When it hits the limited capacity the write operation to the buffer is blocked until you read the output of the pipe.  In the current implementation of `BlobProvider.openFile` it doesn't read in parallel causing it to stay blocked forever if it hits the limited capacity. 


# Replace `master` with `main` 

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/92c13f0d1d9)


# Add support to URI keyboard type in Android (#31781)

This [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1465c8f3874) fixes the `TextInput.keyboardType` equals `url` not doing anything on Android.
