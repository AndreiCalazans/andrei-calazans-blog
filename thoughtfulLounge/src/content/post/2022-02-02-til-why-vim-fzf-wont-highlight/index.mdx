## Today I Learned

Vim's fzf.vim plugin does not syntax highlight unless you have the [CLI bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) program installed.

This was unexpected since I had it working in one computer but not in the other.

I Google searched the following question to get to this answer: `fzf#vim#with_preview preview without syntax highlight`
