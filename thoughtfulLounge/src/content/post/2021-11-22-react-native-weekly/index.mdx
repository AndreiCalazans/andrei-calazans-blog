Welcome to the 35th edition of React Native Weekly! 

This is week 47 of 2021: November 15th to 21st.

# Add onScroll event to the Fabric TextInput

Phillip Pan <phillippan@fb.com> added the missing `onScroll` event to the Fabric TextInput component on iOS.

He [first added the missing](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9822464c991) `onScroll` event to the TextInputEventEmitter [then hooked it up](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/437b06f3974) to the `RCTTextInputComponentView.mm`:

```Objc
+- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
+{
+  if (_eventEmitter) {
+    std::static_pointer_cast<TextInputEventEmitter const>(_eventEmitter)->onScroll([self _textInputMetrics]);
+  }
+}
+
```


# Option to support monorepo/custom location of node_modules [Codegen]

Sota Ogo <sota@fb.com> [added an option](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5e93cf68856) to set where the codegen config files are location, this is specially important for Monorepos.

```
+  .option('c', {
+    alias: 'configFileDir',
+    default: '',
+    description:
+      'Path where codegen config files are located (e.g. node_modules dir).',
+  })
```


# Refactor native Android ScrollView animation code into helper 

Refactor done by Xin Chen <xch@fb.com>, [he organized and extracted the common logic](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/073195991bf) used by the vertical and horizontal scroll views on Android into a helper - `ReactScrollViewHelper`. 

This reduces code duplication and makes the helper share impact surface.



# Add volta support to find-node.sh

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/765844055ba) adds support for [Volta](https://volta.sh/) the tooling manager that can enforce that everyone uses the same tooling versions. I honestly didn't know of this tool.



# Remove soft error when creating preallocated view

While [this change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/db21584ba01) by Andrei Shikov <ashikov@fb.com> seems little, he shares some interesting context around it.

> This is expected with Suspense/CM enabled. We are measuring the perf impact of extra CREATE instructions atm, and will revert the change if it regresses too much.


# Experiment for running JS on view creation

Jimmy Lai <feedthejim@fb.com> launched an experiment to see if they can start the JavaScript work earlier instead of waiting for the View.onMeasure call on Android. 

[This change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2dd33b16df1) starts the JavaScript work on view creation.

If this goes well it could mean a potential start-up improvement on Android.

# Extending Fabric & ViewConfig to support onEnter/onExit/onMove events

This is a series of work done by David Vacca <dvacca@fb.com> to support these events for React Native VR (Virtual Reality). 

While it does not include the implementation of the events yet, maybe to come?, it does the work of:

- [updating the ViewConfigs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/44143b50fdc), 
- [storing metadata on Android](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a9ccdcace53) to know if a view is listening to these events, 
- [updating the Fabric supported events](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/34a5158ec81), 
- and finally fixing an error where to [avoid View flattening if the view is listening to these events](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/26e30a5ee9e).  


**Note about View Flattening**

View Flattening was introduced to improve performance and reduce out-of-memory/stack-overflow errors on Android, with Fabric iOS got it for free since the logic got moved to C++. 

It's good see what disables View flattening, for instance setting `collapsable={false}` to a component will force it and its children to not be flattened. 

You can see the full list of props/settigns that will disable view flattening [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/ReactCommon/react/renderer/components/view/ViewShadowNode.cpp#L34-L54)


# Complete Fabric Native Component Example

Sota Ogo <sota@fb.com> added a Fabric Component example that takes a native View component and extends it to add a `callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor` method.

See complete directory [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/rn-tester/NativeComponentExample) and [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d29f3d2a6b8).

By looking at this implementation you will notice a few things:

**1) MyNativeViewNativeComponent.js defines the JSI layer**

```javascript
interface NativeCommands {
  +callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor: (
    viewRef: React.ElementRef<MyNativeViewType>,
    color: string,
  ) => void;
}

export const Commands: NativeCommands = codegenNativeCommands<NativeCommands>({
  supportedCommands: ['callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor'],
});

export default (codegenNativeComponent<NativeProps>(
  'RNTMyNativeView',
): MyNativeViewType);
```

**2) RNTMyNativeViewComponentView.mm implements the native callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor using Fabric**

```objc
- (void)callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor:(NSString *)colorString
{
  UIColor *color = [self UIColorFromHexString:std::string([colorString UTF8String])];
  _view.backgroundColor = color;
}
```

The Fabric version of `callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor` is much simpler because you don't need to find the View counterpart and also parsing the NSString color is simplified by UIColorFromHexString.

**3) RNTMyNativeViewManager.mm implements the native callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor using the bridge**

```objc
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(callNativeMethodToChangeBackgroundColor : (nonnull NSNumber *)reactTag color : (NSString *)color)
{
  [self.bridge.uiManager addUIBlock:^(RCTUIManager *uiManager, NSDictionary<NSNumber *, UIView *> *viewRegistry) {
    UIView *view = viewRegistry[reactTag];
    if (!view || ![view isKindOfClass:[UIView class]]) {
      RCTLogError(@"Cannot find NativeView with tag #%@", reactTag);
      return;
    }

    unsigned rgbValue = 0;
    NSString *colorString = [NSString stringWithCString:std::string([color UTF8String]).c_str()
                                               encoding:[NSString defaultCStringEncoding]];
    NSScanner *scanner = [NSScanner scannerWithString:colorString];
    [scanner setScanLocation:1]; // bypass '#' character
    [scanner scanHexInt:&rgbValue];

    view.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:((rgbValue & 0xFF0000) >> 16) / 255.0
                                           green:((rgbValue & 0xFF00) >> 8) / 255.0
                                            blue:(rgbValue & 0xFF) / 255.0
                                           alpha:1.0];
  }];
}
```

**4) The podspec call the codegen generator**

```
# Enable codegen for this library
  use_react_native_codegen!(s, {
    :library_name => "MyNativeViewSpec",
    :react_native_path => "../../../",
    :js_srcs_dir => "./js",
    :library_type => "components"
  })
```

I think Sota implemented the bridge example alongside to as an example and also to support for the RN-Tester to work if Fabric is disabled.
