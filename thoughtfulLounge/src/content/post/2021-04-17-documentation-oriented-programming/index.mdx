There are all types of "Oriented-Programming":

- Object Oriented Programming (OOO)
- Data Oriented Programming (DOP?)
- Domain Oriented Programming (DOP? 2)
- Test Driven Development (or programming ðŸ˜…)(TDP?)

You get the point. It is just a pattern or method you can apply while writing code.

So, how about we introduce one new paradigm! 

# Documentation Oriented Programming (Yet another DOP)

I tweeted about this idea on 26th of May, 2020.

# At A Personal Level

In my programming career, I noticed the following things happening over and over:

- Solving the same technical problem.
- Answering the same technical questions.
- Giving the same guidance to different folks.

From this, I came to a realization of how the source of these three items is somewhat the same - programming/experienced knowledge.

While I can undervalue my time and always spend 30 minutes writing a response or discoursing on how something was achieved, it makes more sense to optimize this (_of course, we must optimize, how will I live to my title of software engineer if optimization is not in my head ðŸ˜‚_).


This was when I started taking a "Documentation Oriented Programming" approach.

# Clarity & Writing

**Think Before You Do**  -> **Write Before You Do**

They say you should think, ponder, plan before you take action. However, if you agree with me that writing is the medium for thinking, by writing you are thinking.

1/ Why you need to document things to improve your decision-making, a thread:

"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."

Plus, being able to document your thoughts with clarity is a senior level skill. 

Shawn Wang goes over this in his book "Coding Career" and finds [evidence from interviewing a retired software developer who mentions that the important skills to have are the ability to document and speak with clarity](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1346950991476715521?s=21).

Not to mention, he also follows up with CircleCI's promotion ladder:

's ladder. The 
thing they use to evaluate and promote people.

"Technical skills" is line 7-13. Lines 14-33?

- Dealing with ambiguity
- Knowledge sharing
- Handling disagreement
- Mentoring
- Product Thinking

For the times I felt successful at helping others, it has mostly been because I had done a good job documenting my discovery process and, I simply shared what I had documented. 

# At A Company/Project Level

Just ask yourself, at the current company/project you are at, can someone onboard without help? If the answer is no than you could clearly benefit from a documentation oriented approach. 

While the post talks about programming, documenting is appliable to everything. In my life, I try to document everything I can.
