# Cleaning up in anticipation to removing the Picker Component

The Picker component was selected to be removed from core during the Lean Core initiative, it is now recommended you use [one in the community packages](https://reactnative.directory/?search=picker).

This week there were a few commits that removed the Picker Component from the examples:

```
f12f0e679dd Remove Picker from ScrollView examples
c780366eeed Remove Picker from Android Permissions example
70727a5d449 Remove Picker from TextLegend example
b22a6d6e9d9 Remove Picker from Modal example
572deaebd9c Remove usage of Picker from Accessibility Example
65740723d98 Remove Picker from XHR example
625d9e5090a Remove PickerAndroidTestModule
```

# Avoid re-encoding images when uploading local files [FIX] [iOS]

Arthur Lee <arthur.lee@chime.com> summarizes in his PR that when you upload a local image file the module behind it (`RCXTNetowrkTask`) ends up using `RCTLocalAssetImageLoader` to load that image, however during this load it puts that image onto a `UIImage` and re-encodes it using `UIImageJPEGRepresentation` with maximum compression quality. This inflates the size of the JPG specially for images previously compressed.

His [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f78526ce3d4) fixes the issue by always using the  `RCTFileRequestHandler` for file loads irregardless if it is an image, this module puts the file into a `NSData` which is the required type for `multipart` data appending. 

# Fix NullPointerException during tear down of RN Android

[This diff](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2f943d9d63d) prevents a NullPointerException caused by a race condition in the tear down of React Native.

# Add title to DevMenu

[After this change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cf2238eb66c), the DialogBox will have a title. This should help distinguish between the Bridgeless DevMenu and the Bridge DevMenu.


# DevMenu: Change "Toggle Inspector" to Show/Hide Element Inspector

[This makes](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/e91fb05db7f) the element inspector button consistent with the Fast Refresh, Perf Monitor and other buttons in the DevMenu

# Take RTL into account in scrollTo view command

ScrollView's `scrollTo` command doesn't work in RTL. It sets the offset from left of the screen instead of right. [This diff](9ca460f0640) fixes this for Fabric only.

This is likely just a temporary analytics injections Facebook needs for their production app. Since we can't see the injected code we don't know exactly what it is logging. 


# Bump Flipper to 0.93 (#31708)

# Resolve race condition in usage/teardown of EventEmitterWrapper

This change is a rather funny story of the cascading effect of fixes ðŸ˜‚:

This crash is caused by [D29020768](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/25e8fbe8ffa1c91522e91819a781434093f8b759) which was landed to fix T92179998, which was in turn caused by [D28938637](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ac6d1982f4df55eca4da1cfc588dadc35bc005d0).

Summary:

> In stopSurface we destroy these EventEmitters which is not a threadsafe operation. Wrap usage and destruction of these wrappers to prevent crashes.


This was not the only change, they are struggling with null pointers being passed around and called unchecked. Joshua Gross <joshuagross@fb.com> in this [PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/006f5afe120) tries to make the entire EventEmitter module more resilient around null pointers.


# Flipper Update

[This commit bumps](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4246c75d0d5) flipper deps to 0.91 to support XCode 12.5 out of the box (#31562)



# Finding contributors for the React Native ecosystem 

[In a recent tweet, Eli White](https://twitter.com/Eli_White/status/1406859370160300037?s=20) highlighted how he struggles to find contributors to React Native. Specially experienced iOS and Android developers. If you have a suggestion tweet at him or become a contributor yourself?



# Gestures don't work on Android inside a native Modal component

> Ugh, gestures in react native are complicated Grimacing face worked perfectly in iOS and not at all on android. Turns out gestures donâ€™t work on android if you use them inside the native modal component Woman facepalming so we had to build our own component


# Multifaceted graph perspective of a React Native Developer

[Lorenzo made an interesting graph](https://twitter.com/Kelset/status/1405537049319337996) that displays everything in the React Native ecosystem from the perspective of a developer.
