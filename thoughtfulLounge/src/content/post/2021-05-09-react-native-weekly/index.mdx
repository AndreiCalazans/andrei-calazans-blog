# How To Override CMD+R In Newer IOS Simulators

How to override cmd+r in the newer iOS simulators: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonstuebe/status/1390384513927184385?s=20)

If you don't want change the recording shortcut, you can always type `R` in the Metro CLI to make it reload.

# Shopify's Webinar

Shopify's investment in React Native is absolute. They are doing a webinar on how they write Performant React Native apps: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/1390357971662737408?s=20)

I'll try to make it and summarize what I learn from them.

# Software Mansion's Webinar

Sofware Mansion is also hosting a webinar, for those who don't know Software Mansion is a massive contributor to the React Native ecosystem being the ones behind Reanimated.


[Link to tweet about their webinar](https://twitter.com/swmansion/status/1389610772087644162?s=20)

The topic is Native for React developers, I believe this is a nice topic for those who want to get into React Native from Web.


# React Native Vision Camera V2 Release

[Marc Rousavy](https://github.com/mrousavy) is a prolific contributor to the React Native ecosystem, he is in the forefront of what is possible to achieve with JSI, Turbo Modules, and Fabric. He has published a few libraries exploring the usage of JSI like [react-native-threading](), [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) (key-value storage), and [react-native-vision-camera](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera).

He recently released [react-native-vision-camera](https://github.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera) v2.

In summary it is blazing fast:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

A fully native app written in Objective-C can do this in 68ms

A #ReactNative app using VisionCamera Frame Processors (JavaScript) can do this in 69ms!

There is a single millisecond difference for the bonus of using JS for AI!

# Rescript React Native Release 

For the fans of sound types, no not TypeScript since is isn't sound ðŸ˜…. ReScript React Native is here after its long transition from Reason React Native.

#  Add explicit type casts to fix compilation errors on Windows. (#31363)

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6d04a46f74) 

It is positive to see how the impact surface of React Native core now expands to Microsoft. A recent change to `MapBuffer` broke compilation on Windows. 

React Native certainly needs an automated end-to-end test verification that validates how all of its stakeholders are using React Native. 


# Migrating To Functional Components

Part of an effor to modernize React Native's components. They updated ItemWithSeparator in VirtualizedSectionList, Switch Component, and ScrollViewStickyHeader to be functional.

[ItemWithSeparator Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2e0e3f7ddb) 

[Switch Component Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ab66741c8c) 

[ScrollViewStickyHeader](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/438a4cf59b)


# Accessibility Updates

- [Add support for Toggle Button accessibilityRole](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/da899c0cc4)
- [Fix Image not annoucing accessibilityState disabled](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/333b46c4b0)


# Introduce RCTBundleManager

Part of the Fabric rearchitecture effort, where there will be a "bridgeless" mode. `RCTBundleManager` [introduces](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4a1bafe591) a normalized way to read/write to the bundleURL even in bridgeless mode. Before this, native modules accessed the bridge directly, which will be `nil` in bridgeless mode. 

After this stack lands, every NativeModule will be able to synthesize an RCTBundleManager, like so:
```
synthesize bundleManager = _bundleManager;
```

Interface Header

```
+typedef void (^RCTBridgelessBundleURLSetter)(NSURL *bundleURL);
+typedef NSURL * (^RCTBridgelessBundleURLGetter)();
+
+/**
+ * A class that allows NativeModules/TurboModules to read/write the bundleURL, with or without the bridge.
+ */
+@interface RCTBundleManager : NSObject
+- (void)setBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge;
+- (void)setBridgelessBundleURLGetter:(RCTBridgelessBundleURLGetter)getter
+                           andSetter:(RCTBridgelessBundleURLSetter)setter;
+@property NSURL *bundleURL;
+@end
+
```

As a follow up to the above change, a few native modules have been migrated to use the `RCTBundleManager`.

```
f2157a0558 Migrate RCTDevSettings to RCTBundleManager
eb0a918577 Migrate RCTSourceCode to RCTBundleManager
1f105e6f16 Migrate RedBox to RCTBundleManager
adaa1c98f6 Migrate RCTDevLoadingView to RCTBundleManager
4198c2bcb6 Migrate RCTDevMenu over to RCTBundleManager
```



# [External Collaboration] fix: codegen - project paths with spaces (#31141)

Craig Martin <cmart1220@gmail.com> fixed a codegen script issue that incorrectly split root project paths that contained spaces.

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b2e2f43ec3) 



# [External Collaboration] Add onPressIn & onPressOut props to Text (#31288)

Adrien HARNAY <adrien@harnay.me> added `onPressIn` and `onPressOut` props to the `Text` component to help implement custom highlighting logic (e.g. when clicking on a Text segment). Since TouchableOpacity can't be nested in Text having custom lineHeights without bugs in some occasions, this modification helps to replicate its behavior.

# Resolve Memory Leak In Promises [iOS]

On iOS when using promises with Turbo Modules on iOS, previously they weren't destroying the weak reference to the resolver and rejector callbacks. With block guard they properly destroy it.
