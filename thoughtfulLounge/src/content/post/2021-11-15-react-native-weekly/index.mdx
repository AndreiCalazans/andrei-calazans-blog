Welcome to the 34th edition of React Native Weekly! 

This is week 46 of 2021: November 8th to 14th.


# Make the `reactNativeArchitectures` property more discoverable

Nicola Corti <ncor@fb.com> [added](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0f39a1076dc) `reactNativeArchitectures` property to gradle.properties for you to specify architecture on Android.

# Default {bubbling,direct}EventTypes to {} in Native VCs

Ramanpreet Nara <ramanpreet@fb.com> continued the work to [make the Native View Configs match the functionality of the Static View Config](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/36612a80609).

* The View Config defines the properties you can use/access for the native component counterpart.

Ramanpreet [also did further work](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/73b243acbcb) on the StaticViewConfigValidator he created to make it output objects. The StaticViewConfigValidator creates a diff between the native and static view config to show the difference.


# Support RootView in UIManagerHelper.getSurfaceId

Pieter De Baets <pieterdb@fb.com> had added `getSurfaceId` to UIManagerHelper to get the view tag for Fabric root views. He noticed `getSurfaceId` duplicates the logic for `getSurfaceIdForView` and thus refactors the code by removing `getSurfaceId` in favor of the legacy `getSurfaceIdForView` and extending this latter method to support getting the view tag.

```diff
+    if (view instanceof ReactRoot) {
+      ReactRoot rootView = (ReactRoot) view;
+      return rootView.getUIManagerType() == UIManagerType.FABRIC ? rootView.getRootViewTag() : -1;
+    }
```

# Introduce RootView.onChildEndedNativeGesture method [Android] 

Xin Chen <xch@fb.com> [added](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9b33c31ee02) `onChildEndedNativeGesture` to the RootView interface to let its implementations notify the JS side that a child gesture is ended on Android.

Comment from code:

```diff
+  /**
+   * Helper method that should be called when a native view ends a native gesture (e.g. a native
+   * ScrollView takes control of a gesture stream and starts scrolling). This will handle
+   * dispatching the appropriate events to JS to make sure future gesture is not blocked.
+   *
+   * @param view the View ending the native gesture
+   * @param event the MotionEvent that caused the gesture to be ended
+   */
+  public static void notifyNativeGestureEnded(View view, MotionEvent event) {
+    RootViewUtil.getRootView(view).onChildEndedNativeGesture(view, event);
+  }
```

It is not yet clear how this will be used. But, the comment above implies allowing React Native to be notified when a native view is done with controlling the gesture stream.


# Rename Keyboard.removeEventListener to removeListener

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8880c09076e). 


# Introduce RCTViewUtils

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9fc3fc83acd) is a demonstration by Phillip Pan <phillippan@fb.com> on how C functions are superior to Objective-C++ static class methods because they incur less binary size cost [[1]](https://swolchok.github.io/objcperf/)

He thus converts a static class method used in RCTView to a C function.


# Fix crash on multiple shadow threads [Android]

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9d71b166a6c) by chenmo187 <1731581001@qq.com> fixes a crash on Android where caused by two separate threads accessing/mutating the same resource.

He explains this only happens when you have multiple tabs and with each having its own ReactInstanceManager (maybe caused by using react-native-navigation?), not sure. 


# Pass testID down in Modal

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5050e7eaa17). This was an issue because you couldn't grab the Modal via testID.
