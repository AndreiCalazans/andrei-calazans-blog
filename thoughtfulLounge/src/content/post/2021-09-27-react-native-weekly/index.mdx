Welcome to the 27th edition of React Native Weekly! 

This is week 39 of 2021: September 20th to 26th.


# Donâ€™t hard-code CocoaPodsâ€™s sandbox path

This [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ef5ff3e0554) by Jakob Krigovsky <jakob@krigovsky.com>, now allows you to call `pod install --project-directory=ios` from the root of the project, or anywhere you specify the project directory to be. Previously, this would fail.


# Add cancelButtonTintColor props to ActionSheetIOS

Muhammad Numan <muhammadnuman70@gmail.com> updated the ActionSheetIOS on this [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/01856633a1d)

I was surprised to see changes to the ActionSheetIOS make it to the core since Expo started maintaining [a separate version](https://github.com/expo/react-native-action-sheet) of it since the Lean Core initiative. I recommend you use Expo's version of it instead.

#  Ensure elevated views are behind sticky header in FlatList [Android] [Fix]

# ScrollView automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets prop iOS

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6e903b07fa8) by our infamous Marc Rousavy <marcrousavy@hotmail.com>

The following is taken from the commit summary written by Marc Rousavy <marcrousavy@hotmail.com>.

The `automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets` prop automatically animates `contentInset`, `scrollIndicatorInsets` and `contentOffset` (scroll Y) to avoid the Keyboard. (respecting absolute position on screen and safe-areas)

He also included a fix for the `contentInset` not respected when animating new items with `autoScrollToTopThreshold`.

Why not just use `<KeyboardAvoidingView>`?

Also notice how the `<KeyboardAvoidingView>` does not match the animation curve of the Keyboard
