Dear React Native Developers,

After working with React Native for over 6 years and recently directly helping
Coinbase improve its Retail app cold start performance and overall
responsiveness. I want to show you the tools and methods I use to improve and
fix peformance issues on React Native.

How do I do this?

Overtime, I found that there is a ton of
specific knowledge required to able to analyze performance problems across
Android, iOS, and the JavaScript thread on React Native. Thus, I decided to
write this deepdive.

### What You'll Discover:

**Foundational Knowledge:**

Understand the intricacies of CPU profiling with a clear explanation of key concepts such as sampling, tracing, and the critical differences between them.

**Visual Profiling Mastery:**

Learn to interpret complex profiling data with ease. Get acquainted with flame charts, call stacks, and sampling representations to pinpoint performance hotspots.

**Tailored to React Native:**

Step-by-step guides to profiling the JavaScript thread and native threads on both Android and iOS. No more one-size-fits-all approachesâ€”this is the React Native-specific performance deep dive.

**Practical Tools and Techniques:**

Navigate the landscape of profiling tools with confidence. From Chrome DevTools, Systrace, Speedscope, Perfetto, and React Developer Tools to Xcode Instruments and Android
Profiler.

**Performance Metrics Decoded:**

Beyond just finding problems. Learn which metrics can help diagnose and how to
add them to your app.

**Hands-On Experience:**

Every chapter is infused with practical examples and real-world scenarios to ensure the knowledge you gain is immediately applicable.
