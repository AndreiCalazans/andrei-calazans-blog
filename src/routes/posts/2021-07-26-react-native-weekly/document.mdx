Welcome to the 19th edition of React Native Weekly ðŸ˜…

This is everything that happened in between 19th and 25th of July 2021.



Highlights

- Removed default props from FlatList
- Upgraded Metro to 0.66.2

- New FabricUIManager APIs



# Remove defaultProps from FlatList (#31798)

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7d5895df4e3)


# Upgrade metro to 0.66.2

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cfdc4fed0d0)



# Add unit tests for VirtualizedList render quirks (#31401)


[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cd785585526) summary:

This change adds a series of snapshot tests to validate the render output of VirtualizedList in mixed scenarios. Jest timer mocks are used to measure rendering at different ticks. These test cases mostly center around realization logic, to help prevent regressions when changing internal state representation.

[Good place to look](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/Libraries/Lists/__tests__/VirtualizedList-test.js) if you want to see how to test a FlatList or ScrollView.



# Composing Animations in Animated API Example

[Charles Dudley <charlesdudley@fb.com> added](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a8e0438db29) a Animation composing example page with examples for `parallel`, `sequence`, `stagger`, and `delay` to the rn-tester app.



# Cursor Position Fix on iOS


Two commits, [one](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b0e39b2ed9b) and [two](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/de44184e01d) worked on improving the cursor positon on TextInput for iOS.


# Fix for crash when using PlatformColor on TextInput [Android]

The purpose of [this change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bc57056cc32) by David Vacca <dvacca@fb.com> is avoid a crash when using PlatformColor on TextInput. He 
refactored AndroidTextInput.AndroidTextInput.color prop to use SharedColor instead of int.


# Fix missing autoCompleteType on TextInput for Android

[Original issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/27952). [The change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d9e0ea77f01) that fixes it.

The autoCompleteType on the TextInput was missing the AUTOFILL_HINT_NEW_PASSWORD value, which would help the users when signing up to a service tremendously.

# Rendering thousands of images 

Fernando Rojo demo-ed his work on Beatgig. Pretty impressive rendering of thousands of list items without any flickering.

[His tweet](https://twitter.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1419069216683184130)

He says his secret is:

- FlatList
- memoize everything
- zero logic or functions in the list items
- react-native-fast-image
- *tiny* item components
