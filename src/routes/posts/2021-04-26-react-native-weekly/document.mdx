# Defensive Programming - NativeEventEmitter Checks Add & Remove Listener 

Now, the `NativeEventEmitter` checks if the native module it received when instantiated has add and remove event listener methods.

```
+    const hasAddListener =
+      !!nativeModule && typeof nativeModule.addListener === 'function';
+    const hasRemoveListeners =
+      !!nativeModule && typeof nativeModule.removeListeners === 'function';
+
+    if (nativeModule && hasAddListener && hasRemoveListeners) {
```

# Bump Gradle Wrapper To 6.8.3

This is preparation for Gradle 7.0 version, which supports Apple Silicon natively.

# RuntimeScheduler

The Runtime Scheduler continues to be worked on, the efforts here are all related to Fabric - the asynchronous scheduling system that has priority queues. Most of the work seems to happen in coordination with the React Core team. 


Some updates were:

**Pass hardcoded false argument to scheduled callbacks**

Scheduled callback function expects a boolean param to indicate if a callback timed out. React Core team will remove it, thus they are hardcoding it for now.

```
 void Task::operator()(jsi::Runtime &runtime) const {
+  // Cancelled task doesn't have a callback.
   if (callback_) {
-    // Cancelled task doesn't have a callback.
-    callback_.value().call(runtime, {});
+    // Callback in JavaScript is expecting a single bool parameter.
+    // React team plans to remove it and it is safe to pass in
+    // hardcoded false value.
+    callback_.value().call(runtime, {false});
   }
 }
```


**Implement task continuation**

Commit comment: 

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Scheduler's callback have option to add more work inside callback. This work stays on top of the priority queue and gives React ability to flush all work synchronously if need.

This diff adds use of `shouldYield_` to the workLoop. For now, it always evaluates to false. In the future when we allow access to the scheduler to native, it will allow yielding.

# Fix for 'An Unexpected error occurred' caused by DatePickerDialog.

[This was a fix](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/49af5e7385) introduced because of a error they caught in the Messenger Kids app. The main change is just handling the UI update within the UI thread, on Android you can only make UI changes within the UI thread.

# [iOS] Fix InputAccessoryView disappearing when inputAccessoryViewID exists

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d90253da36) comment:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

InputAccessoryView disappears on Fabric (not Paper) when the text prop changes.

# Bridgeless support for RCTSourceCode

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2c34946662)

I'm not 100% sure how this can be or will be used, but it is simply allowing you to set a URL for your JS bundle instead of a bridge. Let's see if future updates tells us more.


# Fix crash - check if backgroundColor is null before trying to fetch it in ViewProps isLayoutOnly


[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/42b6e6682c) comment:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Summary:
Noticed while working in MobileHome with android device, when interacting with the Tasks change progress/priority components (MobileHomeTasksDetailsSelectorToken), which provides `borderRadius` style and `backgroundColor: ifSelected ? value : null`, and when `backgroundColor` is `null`, the line changed in this diff crashes (throwing the `NoSuchKeyException` at `ReadableNativeMap:110` [because of isNull check on `ReadableNativeMap:107`])

</div>


# iOS 14 Support new DatePicker styles

[This was mostly]((https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2b62e19a78)) about adding if checks for iOS version like:

`+  if (@available(iOS 13.4, *)) {`

And setting the  `view.preferredDatePickerStyle` with the right value.

Some [height updates](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/266b21baf3) to the overall look also happened.



# Introduce drainMicrotasks to JSI

JavaScript VMs (JSVMs) implement internal Microtask (a.k.a. Job in ECMA262) queue to handle job queue (like promises).

This [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bddff73790) implements a new JSI API `drainMicrotasks` to define how hosts may integrate with the JSVMs' internal microtask queue.

Xuan Huang (jsx@fb.com>) documented his changes quite well with extensive comments around his decisions. If you are curious check out the commit and the [jsi.h](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bddff73790/ReactCommon/jsi/jsi/jsi.h) file which has more comments about the `drainMicrotasks`.

Here is an short snippet of something Xuan explained:


<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Notes on the existing APIs from JSVMs

The presence of such queue and APIs to operate on them are
ubiquitous:
- Hermes: `Runtime::drainJobs`
- V8: `MicrotaskQueue::PerformCheckpoint`
- JSC: `VM::drainMicrotasks`
- QuickJS: `JS_ExecutePendingJob`

The only exception is ChakraCore, which requires hosts to provide
the queue and set up the `JsSetPromiseContinuationCallback`,
but a JSI implementation can provide that queue trivially.

</div>

# Perform Engine Microtasks in JSIExecutor

Xuan Huang (jsx@fb.com>) did [further work](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7310847758) on the Engine Microtasks:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

This diff introduce a helper `performMicrotaskCheckpoint` to
repetitively invoke `jsi::Runtime::drainMicrotasks` to exhaust
the microtasks queue provided by JS VMs

</div>


# Refactor: Move RuntimeExecutor into Instance.cpp

While [the change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/db3625a3b0) is trivial, the commit message explains something interesting about the pieces of React Native's architecture such as `NativeToJsBridge`, `RuntimeExecutor`, and `Instance`.

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

RuntimeExecutor is currently declared inside NativeToJsBridge. It doesn't need to be: Instance.cpp can use NativeToJsBridge::runOnExecutorQueue to schedule work on the JS Thread. So, this diff moves RuntimeExecutor out of NativeToJsBridge into Instance.cpp. Now, both the JS CallInvoker and the RuntimeExecutor are declared in the same file.

</div>


# Add flushing to RuntimeExecutor

[commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c0ec82e61e)

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Motivation

With the bridge, every call into JS flushes the queue of NativeModule calls. Fabric bypasses this mechanism, because it uses a RuntimeExecutor that schedules work directly on the JavaScript thread. This diff makes Fabric's RuntimeExecutor also flush the queue of NativeModule calls.

This likely won't fix anything in Fabric, because we don't execute any async NativeModule calls on Fabric. However, this is necessary for the drainMicrotask work we're doing

</div>

+                    executor->flush();
+                  }
```

# How Hermes shranked their heap by 30%

[Tzvetan Mikov](https://twitter.com/tmikov), Hermes' tech lead, shared some insight into how they reduced the engine's heap usage by 30%. He explained they introduced a 32-bit value encoding for values stored in the heap since now all values require 64-bit encoding.
