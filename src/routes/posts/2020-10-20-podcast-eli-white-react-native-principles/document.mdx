In this interview conducted by [Michael Chan AKA Chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic), [Eli White](https://twitter.com/Eli_White) goes over React Native's team principles which he wrote about on [this post](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2020/07/17/react-native-principles/). During the interview he mentioned a bit more than just the principles, he gave us a bit more insight of his perspective of React Native.

<p>
  React Native teams still need native developers
</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White

<i>26:35</i> <p class="was_said">the platform are coming in and saying like we don't need mobile developers anymore and that's not that's not how we we feel</p>



<blockquote class="comment">
<p>
  Native(iOS and Android) developers can help maintain a high bar
</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<i>28:29</i> <p class="was_said">
maintain the bar of what the experience is on these native platforms you know like you have a bunch of ios engineers or android engineers and they're going to not let you say like not let you use react native as an excuse like we really want to make </p>


<blockquote class="comment">
<p>
  You should leverage native code
</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>



<i>29:45</i> <p class="was_said">
or there's already existing code in native to to do that using it in native is is still react native and
we want to encourage that
</p>


<blockquote class="comment">
<p>
  that we've seen have the best success are teams that still have some native engineers

<blockquote class="comment">
<p>Components have a drawback</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>34:14</i> <p class="was_said">
They are shared everywhere but then finding the right components to use
becomes the problem 
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>34:50</i> <p class="was_said">
so we have a bunch of tooling internally to help make this better but uh it's not a it's not a solved problem
</p>



<blockquote class="comment">
<p>React Native incentivizes more generalits supported by fewer specialists.</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>36:09</i> <p class="was_said">
that's actually part of React Native as a whole is that yeah mobile used to be only accessible to people with
deep native expertise but the up
leveling with components and with react native as a whole
has enabled this kind of thing that's required expertise
to be more towards generalists, supported by fewer specialists
</p>

react native is a framework and a technology that transcends facebook

<p>Facebook is working closely with Microsoft because it has internal products using its technology</p>

- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>


<br/>
<br/>
<i>39:08</i> <p class="was_said">
you know partnering really closely with microsoft to support windows and mac and you know we're building up a team to do that because we have
products now at facebook that are using those

<p>Priority is to match native UI expectation</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>40:45</i> <p class="was_said">
priority for react native
is to really match the expectations that
people have
of that platform
</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
<p>The goal is not one code for all platforms (Famous learn once, write everywhere quote in its documentation</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
)</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>41:06</i> <p class="was_said">
the goal isn't like 100% code reuse
the goal isn't that uh you write
one like piece of code and that will run
on every platform look and feel exactly
</p>


<blockquote class="comment">
<p>The challenge about cross platform inconsisntency. For Web devs, they are used to seeing browsers handle UI differently, for Native devs they are used to the platform lock-in. </p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>42:38</i> <p class="was_said">
is that a challenging way to think about
things like or talk about them as you
introduce react native to people
i think it is for
</p>

<p>The trade-offs aren't performance</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>43:56</i> <p class="was_said">
flutter and swift UI and jetpack compose
and a bunch of different choices that people.
the trade-offs that people often talk
about are you know
maybe like performance or uh who
who created it but I think that's not
that's not really the
the things that we really want people to
think about
</p>


<blockquote class="comment">
<p>Eli White thinks Flutter has a different principle when it comes to developer experience, they cherrish it more. </p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>44:47</i> <p class="was_said">
my understanding is that they don't have
the same principle that
for them it matters much more that the
experience is the same across all
platforms
uh not because they want the experience
to be the same across all platforms but
they want the developer experience to be
so great. They want
you to you want they want you to be able
to confidently write code
and have confidence that it's going to
work the same way
</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
<p>Between developer and user experience - React Native chooses user experience. </p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>45:32</i> <p class="was_said">
your belief that you know if it
comes between
a user experience and a developer
experience you're going to choose the
user experience over the developer
experience

<p>React Native Core team is particularly focused on issues at Facebook's scale. Leaving everything else for the community</p>
<br/>
<p>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>46:12</i> <p class="was_said">
for our team it's really important that
we focus on the
kind of issues that we see at that scale
a lot of things that we aren't able to
focus on because they don't
cause us the biggest problems of this
</p>


<blockquote class="comment">
<p>And instead enable other companies to focus on the issues at other scales</p>
<br/>
<p>
- Eli White
</p>
</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>46:12</i> <p class="was_said">
we want to enable other companies that
operate those scales
to really focus on the things that
impact them and

they're really providing out like
high quality
building blocks that people use yeah and

<blockquote class="comment">
<p>More important to enable these companies instead of Facebook doing it all</p>
<br/>
<p>

<br/>
<br/>
<i>51:02</i> <p class="was_said">
i think for us it's more
important to
build our relationship with these
companies and enable them
versus trying to do it all ourselves

for hermes that's

and you know it's not a thing that

<br/>
<br/>
<i>53:51</i> <p class="was_said">
compile that javascript to
uh bytecode that is then execute like
directly executed
and off disk and so there's no there's
no javascript source there's no parsing
there's no
evaluation and it is it is like
actual bytecode instructions

React Core team rethought the core implementation without changing the public APIs to push new capabilities and optmizations not previsouly possible to achieve

## Conclusion

The requirement of native development experience is an important point to make for web developers working with React Native, it is important for them to work towards reducing this knowledge gap. 

Cross-platform can be classified as a generalist trade since it requires broad knowledge that only increases as you work with more platforms. 

And leveraging the platform OEMs/widget is what truly differentiates React Native from other approaches, not performance or who is leading development.
