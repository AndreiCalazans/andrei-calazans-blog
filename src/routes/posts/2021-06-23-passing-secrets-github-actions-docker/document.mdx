I picked a broken service in the company that got ignored because the maintainer left the company, at this point I had no idea how things worked.

The problem seemed to be that we expected an environment variable to be defined within a Github Action task but it was not.

My immediate thought was to solve this by doing:

```diff
+	       env: 
+         API_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.API_ENDPOINT }}
+        API_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.API_PASSWORD }}
```

However, when we ran the Action again it did not work.


# The problem

We are using `docker/build-push-action@v2` to run a Dockerfile and build a Docker image, and push it to Dockerhub. 

When building this image we depend on the `process.env.API_ENDPOINT` to generate the latest GraphQL types from the server and it failed at this point because the variables were not defined.


# How to solve the problem?

<mark>At first I had no idea.</mark>

And since the `env` field simply didn't work I did some research and found out that in order to make things a bit safer Docker allows you to pass `--secrets` to the `build` command that can read from the environment or even the local file system.

# How do you access a Github secret within a Dockerfile when running Github Actions?

I also didn't know, until I found this: [build-push-action/issues/390](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/390). 

**Reading the secret**

It turns out you can grab the secret passed via the `docker build --secrets` by using the `RUN` command as:

`RUN --mount=type=secret,id=API_ENDPOINT` 

This makes the secret `API_ENDPOINT` available as a file at  `/run/secrets/API_ENDPOINT` which you can in turn read and write to the environment variable by doing: `export API_ENDPOINT=$(cat /run/secrets/API_ENDPOINT)`  

The end resut in my Dockerfile was:

```
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=API_ENDPOINT \
  --mount=type=secret,id=API_PASSWORD \
   export API_ENDPOINT=$(cat /run/secrets/API_ENDPOINT) && \
   export API_PASSWORD=$(cat /run/secrets/API_PASSWORD) && \
   yarn gen
```


**Writing the secret**

We already had the Github secret set, and we also already knew that `docker/build-push-action@v2`  accepted the field  `secrets:` from Github Actions.

```
...
-
      name: Build and push
      id: docker_build
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        push: true
        tags: g2idocker/auth:latest
        secrets: |
            "API_ENDPOINT=${{ secrets.API_ENDPOINT }}"
            "API_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.API_PASSWORD }}"
     -
...
```

# That's it

I write this for myself because I'm sure I might need this again one day.
