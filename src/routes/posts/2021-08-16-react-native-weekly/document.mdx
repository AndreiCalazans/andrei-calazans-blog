# Dynamic color borders RNTester example


As we saw in another [React Native Weekly](/posts/2021-06-28/react-native-weekly) when Jordan Becker <jordanbeckerfr@gmail.com> introduced a fix the dynamic colors not updating on the fly, this week his examples were merged.

`PlatformColor` and `DynamicColorIOS` in action:

[This is](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/27fec9569e0) a breaking change, you can expect the `autoCompleteType` prop on TextInput to be just `autoComplete` now.

# Warning for legacy Native Modules

[This change](2b427f86928), [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f536f82e12b) and [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f93d95e0791) adds a flat and logger that can trigger logs for when the legacy Native Modules are used, this is in preparation for Fabric.


# Allow Modal to handle hardware escape key in the same way the back button is handled (#31564)


On Android, when a hardware keyboard is connected pressing the escape key will partially dismiss an active `<Modal>` without calling the `onRequestClose` callback. The modal will disappear, but the underlying activity may still be present, blocking interaction with the main app below and leaving things in a partially broken state.

[This change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f51773ecded) fixes this issue. This is only present in Android.


# Fix TextInput Cursor jumping to the right when the placeholder null [Android]

Quote from [change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/35607535590):

The null value causes the cursor to jump to the right in a TextInput. The fix replaces the placeholder null value with an empty string which avoid calling setHint(null) as causes the placeholder to jump to the right

# Tweet on misconception of React Native's performance

[Ashoat Tevosyan](https://twitter.com/Ashoat) tweeted a very cool thread about the misconception that performance on native apps is by default better than React Native. He explained in his thread how the multi-threaded model of React Native can yield better performance than native, specially with JSI/TurboModules enabled.

[See full thread](https://twitter.com/Ashoat/status/1425906197992026114)

I have witnessed this on apps running on Android TV.
