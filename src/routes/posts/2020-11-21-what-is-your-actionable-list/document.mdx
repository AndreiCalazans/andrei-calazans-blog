This came up while I was thinking about my goals. To become a developer I came up with a plan that resulted in a simple list of actions I had to accomplish to achieve what I wanted. 

There is a [picture of me with a white board](https://medium.com/@andreicalazans/where-you-can-get-to-while-learning-development-with-fcc-and-chingu-cohorts-fcb9d159274d) next to me where you can see the list of things I needed to accomplish.

<mark>This is learning to love and focus on the process more than the outcome.</mark> 

The principle is well shared among productivity hackers. The more you like what you are doing, the more likely you are to achieve goals as side-effects. 

**But why think like this?**

You want to create the habit of listing things to do. This means breaking down your goal into actionable items. The actions are more important than the goal. That's why.
