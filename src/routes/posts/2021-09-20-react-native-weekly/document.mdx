Welcome to the 26th edition of React Native Weekly! 


This is a special edition that contains two weeks: Week 37 and 38. This is everything that happened between the 6th and 19th of September. 

# Fixed LogBoxData ignorePatterns function

wangqingyang <wangqingyang@alsoplanet.com> [improved the comparison logic](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a950634424c) of this function that was previously broken. You can use the `LogBoxData.addIgnorePatterns` to ignore certain logs.


# Add LayoutAnimation support to all ViewKind nodes

Samuel Susla <samuelsusla@fb.com> explained how the LayoutAnimation only animated changes inside a View and a Paragraph node. [His change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/30887403ec4) adds support to any ViewKind now.  

What he did was remove the interpolation logic from the `ParagraphComponentDescriptor` and  `ViewComponentDescriptor` then add it to the  `ConcreteComponentDescriptor` which is the base class for any descriptor or node.


Samuel Susla <samuelsusla@fb.com> also introduced improvements to the LayoutAnimation code. He simplified [(1)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d83c3101447) , organized [(2)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5153b43c6a3), and improved the C++ code [(3)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/84d039aad2b).

_There were quite a few commits by Samuel which I am not linking here, it impresses me how productive Samuel is._



# NativeModule Initialization Improvements

Ramanpreet Nara <ramanpreet@fb.com> [made improvements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ddc4225dd41) to the Native Module initialization logic. It is a bit beyond my understanding and I didn't have the time to properly dig through yet. From what I understood Ramanpreet found some deadlocking code due to the recursive initialization of some modules. He thus moved the initialization logic outside the `setModuleRegistry` to avoid this. 

This is all relevant for the Bridgeless mode AKA Fabric since Native Module initialization is now owned by each module through the "initialize" method introduced in [RCTInitializing](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9b45df1fced066f40034b0a58be6f4caafd5f785).

Ramanpreet Nara <ramanpreet@fb.com> says:

"In general, we shouldn't do any sort of initialization inside setters for these bridge/bridgeless APIs. No other NativeModules do initialization outside of initialize."



# Use Updated Android Locale API 

[Change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b7c023a8c11) by Aaron Grider <agrider@tesla.com>

Summary:
This change migrates fetching locale information from the deprecated Android locale api to the new locale api on sdk version 30+. The old api was deprecated some time ago and should not be used.

https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration#locale

Test Plan:
```js
if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
  locale = NativeModules.I18nManager.localeIdentifier; // returns ex. 'EN_us'
}
```


# Fix missing WebView provider crash in ForwardingCookieHandler [Android]

Rodolfo <RodolfoGS@users.noreply.github.com> explained how this was a regression introduced in 0.62.2. His app had ~0.1% of the users impacted on Android.

# Fix BorderExample Crash on Out of Tree Platforms

[This](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ffcaef64e40) is a simple change for the RnTester, putting it here so you can see the usage of `Platform.select` with `PlatformColor`.

# Set "new task flag" for intent method Android

Krzysztof Borowy <krizzu.dev@gmail.com> [fixed the crash](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/04fe3ed80d9) caused when calling `Linking.sendIntent` on Android.

# Use Gradle Lazy API

Nicola Corti <ncor@fb.com> [introduced updates to the Gradle plugin](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/578cba23380) to use the Gradle Lazy API. He notes that this is a breaking change for users that are testing their Gradle Plugin and for Gradle Kotlin DSL users.


# Do not flatten view if prop accessibilityViewIsModal is true

With [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1ecd98adc7b) views are no longer flatten if accessibility view is a modal.

# Use Fabric by default in RNTester

HÃ©ctor Ramos <hramos@fb.com> [enabled](ead19e13e10) Fabric by default for the rn-tester app for iOS.


# Fix NSInvalidArgumentException for Invalid Font Family Name

Tim Yung <yungsters@fb.com> explained how in certain production scenarios `[UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName:familyName]` returns `nil` and it caused an issue when trying to insert `nil` into NSCache since it is an object type. 

[He fixes](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5683932862a) this by guarding against `nil`.

# Pass accessibilityHint through Button component

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/be5372801a3) ensures `accessibilityHint` is passed down to the Button component.
