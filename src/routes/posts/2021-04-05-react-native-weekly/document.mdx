# The React Native Show Podcast - Episode 4: "Expert Guide to React Navigation"

[Callstack and team did a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2uZe6AkZOM) about React Navigation version 5.  

[Satyajit Sahoo](https://twitter.com/satya164) explained the motivation behind the rewrite and the problems they tried to solve.  

He explained the main reason was to make the React Navigation API dynamic. He also goes over some internal improvements they made like:

- Using Reanimated
- Adding support for native navigators where it matters,
- improvements to the event systems, 
- adding theme support,
- extracting out the UI component library into its own thing,
- and more.


It was a cool conversation, and I enjoyed listening to it.


# Infinite Red React Native Podcast

[React Native for Junior Developers (and Virtual Coffee) w/ Bekah Hawrot Weigel](https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-194-react-native-for-junior-developers) went over the struggles of Junior developers as a whole and tips for choosing a code school.    

This was also a relaxed talk despite them not going over too much of the hurdles with starting out with React Native.   


It got me inspired into writing a post on what are the topics which you need to learn if you want to be a productive React Native developer, reach out to me via Twitter if you would be interested in a post like that = )


# React Native Now Requires cocoapods >= 1.10.1

[b50b7e3a19](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b50b7e3a19) Update React.podspec to require cocoapods >= 1.10.1 (#31134)


# Add getAuthorizationStatus to NativePushNotificationManagerIOS

I'm surprised to see updates to the `PushNotificationManagerIOS`. You can understand the change by just looking at the type definition of this method:

# Return Value To JS Call In UIManagerBinding (Fabric Update)

Can you call a C++ method from the JavaScript thread and get a return value synchronously? Previously no, but with Fabric yes!!!  


```
-static void callMethodOfModule(
+static jsi::Value callMethodOfModule(
```

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a038179b9b) adds the capability for the `UIManagerBinding::callMethodOfModule` to return a `jsi::Value`.


# What is the Paper rendering system?

I don't know. See the commit message:

> Problem: In Paper rendering system, view managers are native modules that are created and retained by the bridge. Whenever rendering layer needs to create a view, it asks the bridge for the view manager. In bridgeless mode, these view managers are never created.


[491ca1d14e](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/491ca1d14e) Create a bridgelessViewManager [2/n]

This likely means Facebook made its own renderer ðŸ˜®. It could be something that does not leverage OEM widgets and instead renders directly to the screen using a Graphics API like Vulkan. Who knows, I hope they share it someday.

There were more commits related to `Paper`:

# Add `displayName` to Touchables To Stop Messing Up Jest

> Since TouchableHighlight and TouchableOpacity are being exported using `forwardRef`, it's messing up jest's snapshots and some matchers.  This commit 4b935ae95f09e4a1eb1e5ac8089eb258222a0f8b fixed this for components being mocked on [setup.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/jest/setup.js). However, these Touchables aren't being mocked.

# LayoutAnimation Engine Updates

There seems to be a refactor effort around the LayoutAnimation driver to improve it. This means we will be getting a more stable and reliable LayoutAnimation API soon.

# C++ 17 in React Native targets.

Woah!! You can write CPP 17 now in React Native = )

# Destroy Callbacks Not Called 

This is a cool memory leak caught fixed by using the `RAII` principles. 

> JSI callbacks are only destroyed if the callback is called. If the callback is never called, we're potentially leaking a lot of callbacks.  To mitigate this, we add a wrapper object that is owned by the std::function. Whenever the std::function is destroyed, the wrapper is destroyed and it deallocates the callback as well.


[3d1afbbda3](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3d1afbbda3) destroy callbacks even if they aren't called, when java object is destroyed


# No More UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in Modal

# Any Invalid Color Now Fallbacks To `0x00000000`

This changes `processColorArray` to always return an array with valid color values. Any invalid color values will fallback to being transparent black, `0x00000000`.

bb6cd56fae RN: Fallback for Invalid Colors in `processColorArray`


# Unexpected Props Will Fail Early

Previously React Native aborted or returned early when running into unexpected props. Now it fails.

[cb37562f83](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cb37562f83) Remove `abort` in props parsing

Commit comment:

Summary:
Goals are:

1. Catch errors in parsing during dev-mode in a way that is disruptive/grabs attention, but has enough information.
2. Use react_native_assert for hitting breakpoints (less useful for Android, more for iOS), and add LOGs for when this code is used in Android (more useful for Android, less useful for iOS).
3. Return sane defaults so that prod cases don't crash, and don't return totally garbage data.

I also found a couple cases where parsing was incorrect before; see WritingDirection and TextAlignment. This could impact some layouts and RTL/LTR potentially.

# More C++ Improvements - Avoid Unnecessary Copies Of Arguments

# More Accessibility Improvements

[7ee2acc6c8](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7ee2acc6c8) Selected State does not annonce when TextInput Component selected (#31144)

> This issue fixes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/30955 and is a follow up to pr https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/24608 which added the basic Accessibility functionalities to React Native.  TextInput should announce "selected" to the user when screenreader focused.  The focus is moved to the TextInput by navigating with the screenreader to the TextInput.
