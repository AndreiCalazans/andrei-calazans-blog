_I'm testing a new format of weekly post where I compile list of udpates React Native had, I might also share things about React Native's community as a whole. If you want to stay update subscribe!_

# [React Native Radio Podcast About Flutter V2.0.0](https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-193-flutter-2-release)

Infinite Red team went over what is Flutter and what updates it received plus their perspectives on how Flutter compares to React Native.

I wrote a [badly written long text](https://andrei-calazans.com/posts/2019-07-30/choose-between-flutter-react-native) on the what is important to know when comparing Flutter with React Native if you are serious about the comparison.

# PressabilityPerformanceEventListener 

[c4c0065b00](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c4c0065b00) Add PressabilityPerformanceEventEmitter  

Facebook added an event listener that allows you to get touch-related performance events

Events are:

```
export type PressabilityTouchSignal =
  | 'DELAY'
  | 'RESPONDER_GRANT'
  | 'RESPONDER_RELEASE'
  | 'RESPONDER_TERMINATED'
  | 'ENTER_PRESS_RECT'
  | 'LEAVE_PRESS_RECT'
  | 'LONG_PRESS_DETECTED';
```

# LeakChecker

This tool checks for memory leaks in native components when its surface stopped. 

From an internal Facebook commit:

`Introducing LeakChecker. A tool that checks if all native components have been cleaned up when surface is stopped.`

```
void LeakChecker::checkSurfaceForLeaks(SurfaceId surfaceId) const {
   auto weakFamilies = registry_.weakFamiliesForSurfaceId(surfaceId);
   uint numberOfLeaks = 0;
   for (auto const &weakFamily : weakFamilies) {
     auto strong = weakFamily.lock();
     if (strong) {
       ++numberOfLeaks;
     }
   }
   if (numberOfLeaks > 0) {
     LOG(ERROR) << "[LeakChecker] Surface with id: " << surfaceId
                << " has leaked " << numberOfLeaks << " components out of "
                << weakFamilies.size();
   }
```

# Virtualized Default Props Being Removed

This was a suprise to me actually. There wasn't any discussion in the community about it, so I presume it was an internal decision.
