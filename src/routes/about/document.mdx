  ### Background

Writing cross-platform Software has been my main focus. For the past five years, I have worked with React and React Native in different industries, from enterprise software, airline app, and streaming video on demand apps. During this time I have developed front-end and back-end applications, on the back-end I worked on a Node.JS GraphQL. Despite my focus on JavaScript, while working with React Native apps I have written modules in Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Swift, and C++.   

Through my career I have been part of projects for different company sizes. From smaller Start-Ups like Lattice, to multimullion dollar corporations like You.i TV where I helped  produce software for companies like Peloton, A&E, NowTV, MediaKind, and others.

I enjoy reading and writing. I have a personal knolwedge system with over 3 years of notes of everything I have thought and seen personally and profesionally. I am not a great writer, but I absolutely enjoy learning to write with more clarity. Besides programming, I love talking/reading about psychology and human behavior.  

Educationally, I got my software engineering degree only after I learned to code and landed my first job. I had concluded a civil engineering bachelors first.  And since I learned to code thanks to the vast free material we find online, until today I approach every topic by learning online.  

Last facts about me. I am brazilian, I can speak English, Portuguese, and some Spanish. I enjoy watching basketball, soccer, and formula 1. And I am the father of an amazing kid called Soter Calazans.
