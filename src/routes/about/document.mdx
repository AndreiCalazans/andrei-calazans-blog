  ### Background

Writing cross-platform software has been my main focus. For the past five years, I have worked with React and React Native in different industries, from enterprise software, airline app, and streaming video on demand apps. During this time, I have developed front-end and back-end applications, on the back-end, I worked on a Node.JS GraphQL server. Despite my focus on JavaScript, while working with React Native apps, I have written modules in Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Swift, and C++.   

Throughout my career, I have been part of projects for different company sizes. From smaller Startups like Lattice, to multi-million dollar corporations like You.i TV where I helped  produce software for companies like Peloton, A&E, NowTV, MediaKind, and others.

I enjoy reading and writing. I have a personal knowledge system with over three years of notes of personal and professional thoughts. I am not a great writer, but I absolutely enjoy learning to write with more clarity. Besides programming, I love talking/reading about psychology and human behavior.  

Educationally, I got my software engineering degree only after I had learned to code and landed my first job. I had concluded a civil engineering bachelor's degree first.  And since I learned to code thanks to the vast free material we find online, until today, I approach every topic by learning online.  

Last facts about me. I am Brazilian. I can speak English, Portuguese, and some Spanish. I enjoy watching basketball, soccer, and formula 1. And I am the father of an amazing kid called Soter Calazans.
