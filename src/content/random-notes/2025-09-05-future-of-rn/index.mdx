_Random notes._

I made [a tweet](https://x.com/Andrei_Calazans/status/1963574979947008133) that
performmed surprisingly well, looks like X/Twitter likes receiving news.


Tweet:
> React Native core team is planning to remove all code related to the old archicture on 0.83. Nice, this will result in smaller IPA/APK sizes.
> At least they will keep the interop layer around

This got me thinking about the future of React Native specially with initiatives
by Callstack folks with a competing framework to Expo [called
Rock](https://www.rockjs.dev/).

It is quite ambitious of Callstack to challenge Expo. But I do see it as a
healthy event for the React Native ecosystem.

I honestly think Expo's solution is a bit bloated. It's hard to be the __framework
that solves it all__.

But I'm in a time in my career where I keep getting burned by over complexity.
This makes me gravitate towards thinner abstractions. For example I'm considering
exploring some ideas around navigation with React's offscreen rendering (now
called Activity) to try to replace the entire stack introduced by
react-navigation and react-native-screens.
