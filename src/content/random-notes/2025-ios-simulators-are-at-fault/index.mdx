Seriously. Everyone doing React Native is doing it on a beefed out MacOS device
while running their app on an iOS simulator.

Then they go on to test their apps on their also maxed out personal handheld
devices. Be it iOS, Samsung S series or Google Pixel phones.

This is why you see so many shitty RN apps running on Android mid to low end
devices.

If your are app is slow in DEV, it will be slow on a low end device. Period.

Default your team to building on an Android low end device and you will have a
performance first approach to app development with React Native.
