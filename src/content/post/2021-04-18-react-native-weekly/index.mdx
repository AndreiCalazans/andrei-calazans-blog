# Bringing Hermes to iOS

Callstack team was the main proponent to getting Hermes released onto iOS. [They will publish a series of articles about it. Keep it an eye out](https://callstack.com/blog/bringing-hermes-to-ios-in-react-native/).


# #2-ranked iOS App and #3-ranked Android App Are Fully Written In React Native ðŸ¤¯

Coinbase's investment in React Native is notorious and serves as an inspiration
for others. [See Jesse Polack's recent tweet about this](https://twitter.com/jessepollak/status/1383175564291239937).


# Multi-threading on Android

[Marc Rousavy](https://twitter.com/mrousavy) is doing some interesting work on
multi-threading in React Native inspired by Reanimated's approach with `worklets`
and `TurboModules`. He keeps making progress and recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mrousavy/status/1383783014895742992) about Android
support.  

Keep an eye out for this [repo](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-multithreading) if you are interested. 


# Don't disconnect DevTools WebSocket connection on Cmd+D

I have experienced this myself and I am sure some of you have too, using Cmd+D
to open the menu ends up disconnecting from the React Native Inspector. The
following [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/60a18c138c) adds a workaround for this.


# Fabric Progress - RuntimeScheduler

This week was full of work on the `RuntimeScheduler`. The `RuntimeScheduler`
works together with the `UIManager` to dispatch events back and forth between
the native and JS layers. 


Some of the work included:

- Implementation of these methods RuntimeScheduler::cancelTask, RuntimeScheduler::now, RuntimeScheduler::scheduletTask, and RuntimeScheduler::getShouldYield.
- Unit testing RuntimeScheduler::cancelTask, RuntimeScheduler::now, RuntimeScheduler::scheduletTask, and RuntimeScheduler::getShouldYield.
- [Improve RuntimeScheduler:scheduleTask to execute multiple tasks within a single dispatch](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/318e9f283e)
- [Implementation of RuntimeScheduler Priorities](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8d5c22edfd)


This priority system will allow for the UI thread to react to more important
tasks and delay response to lower priority tasks. This is a core idea behind
the Fabric rearchitecture and what will make React Native way more responsive
than it is today.

```
+enum class SchedulerPriority : int {
+  ImmediatePriority = 1,
+  UserBlockingPriority = 2,
+  NormalPriority = 3,
+  LowPriority = 4,
+  IdlePriority = 5,
+};
```


# Small Improvements To The Differentiator Module

This module contains a set of functions that does the diff when updating the `ShadowTree` and deciding what
needs to be removed or updated.

```
d1b1e8b80d Differ: ensure all ShadowViews generated by differ have correct LayoutMetrics
c22b874fd6 Differ: ensure ownership of all ShadowView/ShadowNode pairs, ensure consistency of nodes
b9828a8afa Differ: fix edge-case where we "REMOVE" an older version of a ShadowNode
39b8233c93 Copy Differ implementation to new file, feature-flag-gate new differ
5eba5c11b0 Differ: improvements to logging
```

# Disable `accessibilityState` when `TouchableWithoutFeedback` is `disabled`

See [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/697164077c).


# Remove defaultProps from KeyboardAvoidingView

See [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2824b68ee8).

```
-  static defaultProps: {|enabled: boolean, keyboardVerticalOffset: number|} = {
-    enabled: true,
-    keyboardVerticalOffset: 0,
-  };
-
```

# Interesting Stuff From The Community
