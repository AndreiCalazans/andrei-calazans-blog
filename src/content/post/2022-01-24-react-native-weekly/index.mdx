# Fix NPE in ScrollView due to JS error [Android]

Joshua Gross joshuagross@fb.com [fixed a null expection error crash](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2151d115271) happening in the ScrollView that would happen a consequence of an error happening from JavaScript, this NPE would hide the real reason of the crash - the JS error. 

# Auto-label PR opened against release branches

Gabriel Donadel Dall'Agnol donadeldev@gmail.com added this life of quality improvement by using Danger, see [the commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/43e07a4941a) if you are interested on this works.


# Fix Alert's dismiss UI blocker [iOS]

[Issue 32304](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/32304) calls out an bug with IOS 15 runtime where dismissing the Alert blocked user interaction because the Alert's underlying UIWindow was left behind after the dismissal. 

For instance, calling `Alert.alert` as below than dismissing it.

```javascript
    InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {
      Alert.alert('Delete this post?', 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete this?', [
        {
          text: 'Cancel',
          style: 'cancel',
        },
        {
          onPress: () => someFunction(),
          text: 'Delete',
          style: 'destructive',
        },
      ])
    })
```

Asaf Korem asaf.korem@gmail.com [fixes the underlying method](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a46a99e1203) by using the appropriate API for dismissing: `setHidden:YES`


# Fix hitSlop to be set with a single value [IOS]

Pieter De Baets pieterdb@fb.com [fixed an iOS only](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3addafa5257) issue where hitSlop was not set with a single value.

It was interesting to see how in Fabric this was already fixed because of the shared logic for all platforms.



# Fix failure to reload App on JS bundle load error [Android]

[Issue 32898](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/32898) described an bug in Android's dev environment where on connecting a JS bundle and having it fail the user would see a blank screen after reloading the JS bundle with the fix.

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c8d823b9bd9) by Sam Kline samkline@users.noreply.github.com fixes the issue by appropriately resetting ReactInstanceManager's state when createReactContext has an issue - this allows it to correctly restart.

```java
// Reset state and bail out. This lets us try again later.
+                  mHasStartedCreatingInitialContext = false;
+                  mCreateReactContextThread = null;
```


# Fix RedBox displaying with LogBox on logged errors [IOS]

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9d2df5b8ae9) by Liam Jones liam@stardive.co.uk fixes an issue where calling `console.error` caused the RedBox to appear alongside the LogBox.



# Migrate ScreenshotManager from NativeModule to TurboModule in RNTester

Paige Sun paigesun@fb.com [added a patch](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b13e41d98e8) to migrate the ScreenshotManager to use its TurboModule version.

While this is a simple change, what caught my attention was her comment that states how in "Bridgeless" mode using `NativeModules.<module>` will throw an error, it made me wonder if this means that TurboModules are backwards compatible, maybe not? 


# Add platformConfig to the Animated API

Eric Rozell ericroz@fb.com [added a way to pass an extra config object called platformConfig](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4a227ce2ab3) to the Animated API which can be helpful to optimize and experiment with different behaviors on different platforms, he gives the example of `react-native-windows`.  

> The ability to pass an additional property bag to further configure NativeAnimated is useful for a few reasons, e.g., experimentation with multiple implementations of the NativeAnimated module.


# Remove Detox 

Lorenzo Sciandra notkelset@kelset.dev [removed Detox](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ac206aa814c) since was not being used in the core repo. At least for now until it is decided that it is needed again.

# Add `vendor/bundle` into .gitignore template 

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2f67f5d68b1)


# Add menu to test-manual-e2e script

Gabriel Donadel Dall'Agnol donadeldev@gmail.com [extended the `test-manual-e2e`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1ec399781df) script in the core repo to have a menu for you to choose which test you want to run. This script is specially useful to run things in the core repo like running the RNTester app or starting a template app.

# Continue work on matching SVC and NVCs

Ramanpreet Nara ramanpreet@fb.com [continued the work](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0343e697fdb) of making the Static View Configs match the Native View Configs and vice-versa. Learn more about this in [last weeek's post](/posts/2022-01-17/react-native-weekly).


# Fix race condition in Websocket's implementation [IOS]

Michelle Laurenti asmeikal@me.com [fixed an](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/86db62b7a8b) where a race condition caused the WebSocket frame payloads to be processed incorrectly.

According to the commit message:

> This can cause errors on RFC6455 compliant WebSocket servers:
> - the server sends a ping frame with no payload
> - the server sends a text frame with a payload longer than 125 bytes
> - the client answers the ping with a pong frame echoing back the contents of the text frame
> This is caused by concurrent modification of the current frame contents, that is passed by reference to the handlers. The concurrent modification happens [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/Libraries/WebSocket/RCTSRWebSocket.m#L1162).

# Add pointerEvents prop support [Android]

With Xin Chen xch@fb.com [patch](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/48f6967ae88), Android's ScrollView now supports [pointerEvents prop](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/view#pointerevents).

# Updated doc to disable Fabric in the RNTester
