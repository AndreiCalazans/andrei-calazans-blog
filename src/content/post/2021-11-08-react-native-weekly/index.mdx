Welcome to the 33rd edition of React Native Weekly!

The week 45 of 2021 was a slower than usual week, it contains all the work in-between: November 1st to 7th.

# Workflow for version labels

Lucas Bento lucas.bsilva@outlook.com's [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/60352a95492) added Github actions to 1) create a label for each released version and 2) automatically apply this label version when an issue is opened mentioning the given version.

If you want to take a look at the Github Actions Lucas created you can find them here: [Create version label](https://github.com/lucasbento/core-workflow-create-version-label) and [Apply version label](https://github.com/lucasbento/core-workflow-apply-version-label).

Add workflow to create version labels on new releases (#32508)


# Changelog moved back to core repo

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/38381c8a2e0) adds the release changelog back to the core repo. It was previously hosted a [React Native Community repo](https://github.com/react-native-community/releases).


# Improvements to Codegen

Ramanpreet Nara ramanpreet@fb.com and HÃ©ctor Ramos hramos@fb.com made a few changes to the Codegen logic.

Most notable [Ramanpreet refactored the use of string replace for the use of templates](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3848f48943d).

# Fix split-screen app reconstruct

somena1 sophiaesiri.ee@gmail.com fixed an issue related to split screen Android devices.

> When switching between split screen or resizing the screen window on Android causes a restart by reconstructing the app components as described on this issue https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25040

The fix is to add `screenLayout` and `smallestScreenSize` to `AndroidManifest`'s `android:configChanges`


# Remove iOS 11 availability check

[This commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9b059b67092) by Ken Tominaga ken.for.develop@gmail.com is a good reminder that React Native mininum iOS deployment target is iOS 11.



# Check for double dispose when sending touch event [Android]

Andrei Shikov ashikov@fb.com [found a double dispatching](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/deb6fbd9291) issue with touch events on Android.

```java
-      TouchesHelper.sendTouchEventModern(rctEventEmitter, this, /* useDispatchV2 */ true);
+      if (verifyMotionEvent()) {
+        TouchesHelper.sendTouchEventModern(rctEventEmitter, this, /* useDispatchV2 */ true);
+      }
```

# Ensure WritableMap is copied before consuming object

[In another commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5c045861b98) Andrei Shikov ashikov@fb.com also fixed an issue with touch events where the touch objects would cause crash in production due to high-firing conditions for CANCEL events.

And this was caused by the `WritableMap` object not being properly copied over.


# Allow setting architecture in RNTester and release builds

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/43c38cdc8e3) by Neil Dhar neildhar@fb.com

You can now do specify the native debug architecture when building the rn-tester:

`./gradlew  -PreactNativeDebugArchitectures=x86_64 :packages:rn-tester:android:app:installJscDebug`
