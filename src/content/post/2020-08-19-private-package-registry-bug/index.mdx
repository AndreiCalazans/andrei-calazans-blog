<h2 id="issue">The Issue ðŸ˜…</h2>

While working on a client project, I ran into an issue with their private registry. I kept seeing the unauthorized error when I ran `yarn install`. It was a weird issue especially because I had all of the correct keys. After some investigation I found out I was using the wrong `_auth` value.


<h2 id="learned">Things I Learned</h2>

1) When you run `yarn install` it searches for `.npmrc` and `.yarnrc` from your directory all the way up to your `~`. You can see this happen by running `yarn install --verbose`.

*Logs from `yarn install --verbose`*
```
yarn install v1.19.1

```

By doing this yarn composes all of the configuration values from `.npmrc` and `.yarnrc` into a single global dictionary which you can verify by running `yarn config list`.

```
info yarn config
{
  'version-tag-prefix': 'v',
  'version-git-tag': true,
  'version-commit-hooks': true,
  'version-git-sign': false,
  'version-git-message': 'v%s',
  'init-version': '1.0.0',
  'init-license': 'MIT',
  'save-prefix': '^',
  'bin-links': true,
  'ignore-scripts': false,
  'ignore-optional': false,
  registry: 'https://registry.yarnpkg.com',
  'strict-ssl': true,
  'user-agent': 'yarn/1.19.1 npm/? node/v13.6.0 darwin x64',
  lastUpdateCheck: 1597857181992
}
info npm config
{
  '@your_company:registry': 'https://your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/',
  '//your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/:_auth' : 'some_secret_token',
  '//your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/:always-auth' : true,
  python: '/usr/bin/python'
}
```

The interesting part about this is the overriding behavior of the deeper configs. If you are currently in `~/projects/cool_app/`, the `.npmrc` file in this directory will take priority over the one in `~`.


<h3 id="wrong_solution">2) Variables Can Be Global And Scoped</h3>

Private registries require a `_password` or `_auth` token to authentiticate. When you set the value to these tokens you can set it globally as follows:

```
_auth=${REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}
always-auth=true
```

By doing the above, these values are globally set and every private registry you use will use that `_auth` token.
And this is when I thought I had a solution since I technically had fixed the issue I was seeing after I set the `_auth` token per scope as follows:

```
@your_company:registry=https://your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/
//your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/:_auth =${REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}
//your_company.jfrog.io/your_company/api/npm/jspkg/:always-auth=true
```

what I didn't realize, I was making another mistake previously, which was using the wrong values for the `_auth` token.

<h3 id="right_solution">How to provide credentials to NPM private packages</h3>

While working on this, [Jarek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaroslawmarek/) pointed out to me that NPM private packages have two ways of receiving credentials, either with `_auth` or with `_password` and `_username` tokens.

The `_auth` value is composed of the your `username` and `API Key` encoded as base64 in the following format: `username:API_Key`.

I made the mistake of copyng the `_password` value and setting it as the `_auth` value on one of my private registries. And thus I kept getting unauthorized.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

Make sure you are scoping these config variables to your registry. You can that by setting as `//${your_company_registry}/:${variable} = ${value}`. And always double check you have the correct credentials format if you use either `_auth` or `_password` plus `_username`.
