# Fabric Support For Mapbuffer

[91b3f5d48a](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/91b3f5d48a) `Implement and integrate Mapbuffer`

This is not yet fully document, and I'm not 100% I understood it, but what it seems to be is support for you to bridge Mapbuffers via Fabric.

```
+/**
+ * TODO T83483191: add documentation.
+ *
```

I will keep an eye for when the documentation gets added.



# Introducing Timeline: A time-travel debugging tool (cross-platform part)

[336876509c](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/336876509c) `Introducing Timeline: A time-travel debugging tool (cross-platform part)`

The `TimelineController` is a C++ class friend of the UIManager class which allows you to rewind the series of UIManager commits with the `TimelineHandler` class.

Remember that the UIManager makes commits to update how the UI looks.

These classes will likely be used in a near future with a debugging tool to allow you to time travel UI updates similar to how Redux can time travel state updates.


> This is a core part of the Timeline feature (aka Time Travel Debugger). With these new primitives, any external library can initiate "saving" all the previous interface changes (commits) and unwind to any previous one (in order to introspect and validate visual side-effects).

```
+/*
+ * Provides tools for introspecting the series of commits and associated
+ * side-effects, allowing to "rewind" UI to any particular commit from the past.
+ */
+class TimelineController final : public UIManagerCommitHook {
```  

# Fix ScrollViewStickyHeader to push up header above it

When there are multiple sticky headers, ScrollViewStickyHeader should push up the header above it when it gets to the top.  This behavior was accidentally changed previously.

> When there are multiple sticky headers, ScrollViewStickyHeader should push up the header above it when it gets to the top.  This behavior was accidentally changed in D21948830 (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/fa5d3fb6b8c561b749f3e86316d06543a52dcc1c) when this component was fixed to work in Fabric.

# Weird VirtualizedSectionList Injection

I was curious to see this commit `Refactor renderItem logic and gate changes` but it seems it is pointing to some new `VirtualizedSectionList` that is not public to open source =/
