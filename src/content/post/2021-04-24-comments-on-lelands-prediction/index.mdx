On April 12, 2017, Leland Richardson who then worked at Airbnb in its mobile
development efforts using React Native tweeted the following:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>
Leland Richardson @intelligibabble Apr 12, 2017

Prediction:

2y from now: react and react native will still be popular.

4y from now, we'll be using "react" except in a strong typed lang

[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/852343893152550914)
</div>

While predictions can carry optimism, most did agree with two of the
three elements of this prediction back in 2017.

The controversial prediction was using React in a strongly typed language.


# The 2021 React Summit Panel

I had an amazing opportunity to discuss the above prediction in a [panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsAJfiuVvu8) brought
you by [G2i](https://g2i.co) at the React Summit 2021.

At the panel, we discussed a few important points, however, I felt that much
more could have been said of which time simply did not allow us to. Thus, I am writing
this piece to bring you more information.

# What 2017 Looked Like

To understand Leland Richardson's view I think it is important for me to
explain what was happening in 2017.

React was the most popular web framework with Angular as a runner up. It had
recently became the most popular by numbers if you look back at the 2017 State
of JavaScript survey.

React Native was about two years old on version 0.4X and had plenty of bugs on
its core, specially on Android. While Flutter had been released, it was in beta
and unreliable to use for production - no one was even mentioning it as an
alternative to cross-platform from React Native. The JavaScript cross-platform competitors to React
Native were NativeScript, Ionic, and Cordova (PhoneGap).

And TypeScript was not as popular as it is today, specially with the React
crowd, "pre-2017ish" TypeScript was used more with Angular projects. For React,
[Flow](https://flow.org)'s default support made it easier to opt into Flow instead if
you wanted static types. Further, [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) had recently been announced and had
a lot of hype from early adopters.


# React's Popularity

The first prediction mentioned how React would still be popular in 2019. This was
certainly the most likely event to happen since React had in 2017 recently
taken the throne.

Interesting enough, right around 2019 Svelte does get more attention.
Nevertheless, despite some advocating for its compiler advantages and
great developer experience, Svelte has not dethroned React.

However, at the end of 2018 something does happen which could change the course
of React. React Hooks are released.

Openning for me to promote another blogpost I have ðŸ˜…: [why were hooks created?](/posts/2020-11-01/hooks-were-not-made-to-give-state-to-functions)

The advent of hooks takes React into a new direction that could potentially
damage its popularity.

While this has not happened, we can see some being vocal about their
discontentment with React Hooks on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg/status/1379871612879597568) and [tech article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-ugly-side-of-hooks-584f0f8136b6)s. They seem to highlight the following cons:

- Overly complex.
- Hard to scale since you lose the mental model, clarity, and traceability of
    lifecycle methods.
- Higher coupling of business logic with React.
- Too magical.

At the end, React hooks created stateful and effectful functional components,
which bothered the FP purist crowd, but satisfied the pragmatist crowd because
it was simply less code and more practical to use.

But, no matter what, it seems there will always be a "against it" crowd. Before
React hooks, class components and JSX were the main targets. I guess it only
becomes a problem for the framework when you have more on the "against it"
crowd.

And despite us being at a React conference, when we polled the event about
other frameworks we saw how they continue ubiquitious.

# React Native's Popularity

React Native on the other hand, did not in 2019 have an absolute reign.

Leland worked at Airbnb while its mobile division used React Native, and
concidentially or not to Leland's prediction [Airbnb actually sunsets React Native usage in 2018](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a).

Further, in December 4th, 2018 Flutter announces its 1.0 version making everyone
question if React Native is the best approach to cross-platform. This is
followed by a few interesting companies annoucing they will use Flutter, most
remarkably
[Alibaba](https://alibabatech.medium.com/utilizing-flutter-best-practice-from-alibaba-236a53aa32c8) and [Nubank (Brazilian Fintech worth billions)](https://medium.com/building-nubank/https-medium-com-freire-why-nubank-chose-flutter-61b80b568772).


While, React Native never truly got a grip on the mobile development world, it
has always been second to native approaches when it comes to popularity, we
could say it has achieved strong popularity in the JavaScript world as a way
to use React to build mobile apps. And I honestly believe that is the main
reason why React Native is popular in JS - because of the ability to use React's
mental model to build apps with JavaScript.

So we can say:  "yea sure", React Native has maintained its popularity in the JavaScript
community. But, not as confident as we say with React for web.

# Strongly Typed Languages

The last prediction was about the usage of React in a strongly typed language.

First, we need to understand what "strongly typed language" actually means, and
unfortunately even the definition we get from Wikipedia is not very clear:

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>
In computer programming, one of the many ways that programming languages are colloquially classified is whether the language's type system makes it strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). However, there is no precise technical definition of what the terms mean and different authors disagree about the implied meaning of the terms and the relative rankings of the "strength" of the type systems of mainstream programming languages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing
</div>


But, in the Twitter thread which Leland makes his prediction he does share
which languages he has in mind: [ReasonML](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/852344795443765248?s=20) with [Kotlin, Swift, and F# as possible
contenders.](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/852345148046426112?s=20)

Others in the same thread mentioned Elm, however, Elm has its own UI framework so
it does not apply to this prediction. (And Elm has not gained mass adoption
despite Richard Feldman's efforts ðŸ˜…)


But, what has happened?

**TypeScript has gotten mass adoption.**

<img alt="Crowd poll on compiled to JavaScript picks" style={{ width: '100%' }}
src={rendered_to_js.src} />

94% of the developers watching React Summit 2021 said they use TypeScript with
React.

And we can see the remarkable growth from 39% to 78% usage of TypeScript in the
JavaScript community recorded by the State of JavaScript survey.

[2020 State of JavaScript - JavaScript Flavours Usage](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking)


**But, is TypeScript a strongly typed language?**

First, since the definition of strongly typed is up for interpretation it becomes hard
to straight up answer yes or no. The following thus is a personal take.

For me it is **not**.

TypeScript intentionally makes design decisons that results in an unsound type system.


<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

TypeScript [gave up type soundness](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals#non-goals) from its conception [by design](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22By+Design%22), so one can never be 100% sure that the types you write will type check as expected.

[Quote from Javier Chavarri's blog on Language Debt](https://www.javierchavarri.com/language-debt/)
</div>



Ryan Cavanaugh, Engineering Lead for TypeScript, openly says you should look
for an alternative if you want a sound type system.

<div style={{ borderLeft: "4px solid gray", paddingLeft: 20 }}>

Ryan Cavanaugh @SeaRyanC Jan 24, 2019

Why not just pick up Reason, PureScript, Rust, or any other number of other sound languages that can target JS? Trying to bolt on a truly sound type system onto JS syntax/semantics cannot be done ergonomically

[Ryan's Tweet](https://twitter.com/SeaRyanC/status/1088594722296229888)
</div>


When [Orta talked about why TypeScript is popular](http://orta.io/notes/js/why-typescript) he mentions the caveat that
TypeScript only aims to "feel correct in a lot of case" opposed to "being
correct".


# What Will 2025 Look Like?

I think React will still be widely used. We are likely to see another UI
framework gain ground with a similar mental model of components. I do think
there is an interesting shift from runtime frameworks to compiler frameworks
like Svelte.

For React Native, it is losing ground to Flutter because it has no intention of
becoming a complete SDK for cross-platform development, plus in my personal
opinion Facebook's strategy of having an internal non-opened "Facebook-First-Approach" to developing React Native is not ideal for the external users. Of course, we do see large enterprises using React Native, nevertheless, these companies have the budget and ability to easily move away from React Native if they decide.

However, I don't think there is a strong alternative to React Native for
JavaScript developers at the moment. The main reason is to drive mass adoption this
technology must be backed by a big tech (FAANG) which none exist right now for
JavaScript cross-platform and the alternatives not backed by big tech are simply ignored by the masses. It is unfortunate since I believe React Native is a
local maxima of what could be achieved in this space.

Strongly typed languages won't go anywhere. I much prefer working with a
strictly typed language like OCaml, but it is a niche in which the advocates for it will continue to exist, but at least in the near future it will not become mainstream.


# G2i's Blogpost

Tejas also posted a blogpost about Leland's prediction prior to our panel which you can find it [here](https://www.g2i.co/blog/the-leland-prediction-4-years-later).

# Thank You!

This was a large post, but I totally enjoyed writing it and I hope you enjoyed
reading it. Thank you.
