# Release of Reanimated 2.2.0

This release is more bug-fix oriented but expect something special in the next alpha release Eyes
- Fixed debugging issue on Hermes 
- Support for @quilted/react-testing
- withDecay improvements

# ClojureScript With React Native

[Thomas tweeted a blogpost](https://twitter.com/athomasoriginal/status/1397250898603221006?s=20) that detailed Vouchio's journey with this stack.


My take is ClojureScript has an amazing Repl environment that allows you to quickly iterate. I know we could already do something similar with Node.js REPL, I wonder if we could with React Native.

# Expo CLI Run Commands

Expo is bringing much of the abstraction that existed in the "managed" workflow to the "bare" workflow. For those who don't know, Expo initially only had a "managed" workflow where everything was handled internally by their SDK and if you needed to make native changes you would have to eject. They changed this and broke it up into two.

CLI Run Commands abstracts away a few annoying things like:

- Code Signing
- Better Warnings & Errors
- Prebuilding and config plugins

[The article](https://blog.expo.io/introducing-expo-run-commands-835ae8da4813) is full of details and I recommend the read. Given how Expo is invested in open source culture and React Native it is only time before they become the absolute way of making React Native apps.


# Upgrade jsc-android to 250230.2.1 (#31304)

Upgrade jsc-android to latest stable version. This should finally fix https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25494.
Before Hermes totally replaced JSC, it should be worth to have this and make JSC stable.

# Refactor LockFreeEventDispatcherImpl 


Joshua Gross joshuagross@fb.com refactored the Java implementation of LockFreeEventDispatcherImpl, responsible for dispatching events between the JS and native threads. 

He found that LockFreeEventDispatcherImpl was triple queuing events when in "staging", "dispatch events" in JS, and again when sent to C++. The refactor eliminated one level of queuing - the "dispatch events" queue for the JS thread.


There were some more implementation details that impacted the AsyncEventBeat in C++, check out the [Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5a9b6fc49b).


# Refactor EventQueue

[Another refactor took place](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/285406103d) where Samuel Susla samuelsusla@fb.com simplified the core EventQueue implementation by pulling out some logic and placing it in EventQueueProcessor. It now holds the logic for flushing events.

```

+class EventQueueProcessor {
+ public:
+  EventQueueProcessor(EventPipe eventPipe, StatePipe statePipe);
+
+  void flushEvents(jsi::Runtime &runtime, std::vector<RawEvent> &&events) const;
+  void flushStateUpdates(std::vector<StateUpdate> &&states) const;
+
+ private:
+  EventPipe const eventPipe_;
+  StatePipe const statePipe_;
+};

```

# Add Getters For Event Priority To UIManager

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1866566d52)

Introduce a way to specify React priority for events.

These APIs will be called from React here: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0e100ed00fb52cfd107db1d1081ef18fe4b9167f/packages/react-native-renderer/src/ReactFabricHostConfig.js#L345


The implementation adds an enum for event priorities and binds them to the UIManager.

Enum:

```
+enum class ReactEventPriority {
+  /*
+   * Event priority is unspecified.
+   */
+  Default,
+
+  /*
+   * User events that happen at discrete times, like
+   * input into text field.
+   */
+  Discrete,
+
+  /*
+   * “fluid” user events that happen many times over a short period of time like
+   * scrolling.
+   */
+  Continuous,
+

```

UIManager binding:

# Return Event Priorities To JS

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2016460528)

This is a mechanism that will guess event's React priority based on other events ongoing on the platform.

If an event happens within span of ContinuousStart -> ContinuousEnd and its category is unspecified, we deduce it's React priority to be default. All other events are discrete.

Special case: `onScroll`, which is always treated as "Default".

# Introduces synchronous access to the runtime from RuntimeScheduler

# Fix for ScrollView race condition between C++ state update and onScroll

There is a possibility of race between updating scrollview's state and virtualised list asking for layout of individual cells.
To make sure the race doesn't happen, state must be updated before dispatching onScroll event.

# Adds accessiblity actions on core components (#31532) [External Contribution]

Contribution by Dennis Urtubia dennisurtubia@alunos.utfpr.edu.br.

Summary:
Android: Adding custom actions (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/30854).
Adds accessiblity actions on core components (Button, TextInput, Text, and Picker).

He added support for "accessibilityActions" and"onAccessbilityAction" props.

```
+          <Button
+            accessible={true}
+            accessibilityActions={[
+              {name: 'activate', label: 'activate label'},
+              {name: 'copy', label: 'copy label'},
+            ]}
+            onAccessibilityAction={event => {
+              switch (event.nativeEvent.actionName) {
+                case 'activate':
+                  Alert.alert('Alert', 'Activate accessiblity action');
+                  break;
+                case 'copy':
+                  Alert.alert('Alert', 'copy action success');
+                  break;
+              }
+            }}

```
