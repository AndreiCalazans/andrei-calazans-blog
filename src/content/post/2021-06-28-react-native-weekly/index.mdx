Welcome to the 15th edition of React Native Weekly = ) 


# Update Moving Box Example 

[Just an update](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/fafd2903f11) to the example that refactors a class component into a function component. I highlight the usage of `x.current.resetAnimation` to reset instead of setting the value back to the initial value.

```javascript
...
  const x = React.useRef(new Animated.Value(0));
  const [boxVisible, setBoxVisible] = React.useState(true);

  const moveTo = (pos: number) => {
    Animated.timing(x.current, {
      toValue: pos,
      duration: 1000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  };

  const toggleVisibility = () => {
    setBoxVisible(!boxVisible);
  };
  const toggleText = boxVisible ? 'Hide' : 'Show';
  const onReset = () => {
    x.current.resetAnimation();
  };
  ...
```


# Picker/PickerIOS officially removed

Part of the Clean Core efforts which surprisingly has not finished. [Remove Picker/PickerIOS export](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ad0ccac0d64) from react-native and delete JS related code



# Move RuntimeScheduler initialisation to the start of the runtime

[While this change](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/130b0f69eeb) is just a implementation detail, I thought it was interesting to highlight how React Native is being tested in Facebook's production apps. 


> Reland of [D29131766s](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/18165367b0347fc46cd52a6ac00afcf62d05cb30) which had to reverted because it caused binary size regression in instagram.

So far I have seen commits mention Instragram, Marketplace, FB Dating, and Messenger Kids.

This certainly bulletproofs React Native for large production apps. For example, this week the core team [reverted](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/e83feffeba5) the "Avoid re-econding images when uploading local files" commit that went in last week because it was causing an uploading error in their FB Dating app.

If Facebook was not running React Native in their production apps these bugs would leak into the larger users of the codebase.


# Allow PlatformColor to work with RCTView border colors

[Commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c974cbff04a) from Danilo BÃ¼rger info@danilobuerger.de

> Using `PlatformColor` with border colors doesn't work currently when switching dark mode as the information is lost when converting to `CGColor`. This change keeps the border colors around as `UIColor` so switching to dark mode works.

```javascript
<View
  style={{
    borderColor: DynamicColorIOS({ dark: "yellow", light: "red" }),
    borderWidth: 1,
  }}
>
...
</View>
```

 

# Is a refactor of the `VirtualizedList` coming our way?


It's what [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5cb2debbea5) indicates. Nick Gerleman ngerlem@microsoft.com added `CellRenderMask` module that will help track regions of cells/spacers within a list to render. 

> The implementation keeps this region list internally, splitting or merging regions when cells are added. This output will be used by the render function of a refactored VirtualizedList.



# Liquid Swipe - Can it be done in React Native?

William Candillon never stops to impress me, this liquid swipe animation is just mind-blowing.

[Source code](https://github.com/wcandillon/can-it-be-done-in-react-native/tree/master/season4/src/LiquidSwipe)

It amazes me he was able to do that animation with **456 lines of code spread in 6 files**.

# rnn-starter kit

I ran across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/kanzitelli/status/1407140598814064643) on rnn-starter's recent upgrade to latest Hermes and other libraries, I checked it out and it looks like a cool starter scaffold. See [repo](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rnn-starter)
