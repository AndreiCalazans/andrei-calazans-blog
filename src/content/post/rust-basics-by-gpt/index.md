## Preface

In my spare time I have been learning Rust. Its knowledge intersection with C,
C++, and Haskell make it a fun language to learn.

The one thing that stood out during this process though has been my usage of
ChatGPT to instruct me. Instead of reading a pre-published book I simply had
ChatGPT write the book as I dove into each subject.

This post is the entire conversation I had with ChatGPT. Particularly its
responses.

You can see the code I wrote based on these instructions [here](https://github.com/AndreiCalazans/code-compedium/tree/8b125dd787b776f2990abe42ad37b80d78110d9b/src/learn_rust/src).

_ps: I don't even know what to say about copyright. This entire thing was
simply spit out by ChatGPT and my job in this was simply validating everything
it said and trying out its code samples_
