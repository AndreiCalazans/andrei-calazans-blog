Using predefined error constants like `const VALIDATION_ERROR = new Error('Invalid input');` may seem convenient, but it introduces **misleading stack traces**, which can complicate debugging and error tracking.

## The Issue: Misleading Stack Traces

When you create an error object, its stack trace is captured at the point of instantiation. If you reuse a predefined error, its stack trace points to where it was defined, **not where it was thrown**.

```javascript
const VALIDATION_ERROR = new Error("Invalid input");

function validateInput(input) {
	if (typeof input !== "string") {
		throw VALIDATION_ERROR; // Stack trace points to definition, not here
	}
}
```

This makes it harder to locate the actual cause of the error.

## Better Approach: Create Errors Dynamically

To ensure accurate stack traces, instantiate the error when throwing it:

```javascript
function validateInput(input) {
	if (typeof input !== "string") {
		throw new Error("Invalid input"); // Stack trace points here
	}
}
```

For reusable error messages, use an **error factory**:

```javascript
function createValidationError(message) {
	return new Error(message);
}
```

## Why It Matters

- **Accurate Debugging**: Stack traces point to the actual problem.
- **Better Tool Integration**: Tools like Bugsnag and Sentry rely on correct stack traces.
- **Clarity**: Makes finding and fixing issues faster and easier.

Avoid predefined errors to simplify debugging and improve maintainability.
